question,answer
"What is the relationship between Dojo and Cairo?","Dojo provides an abstraction layer over Cairo, enabling developers to use concise commands that transform into comprehensive queries at compile time."
"What is the architecture of Dojo?","Dojo encapsulates boilerplate contracts within the compiler, allowing developers to focus on data and logic, while the compiler generates foundational contracts."
"How are Dojo contracts specific ?","Dojo contract is just a regular Cairo contract, with some dojo specifics."
"How are states defined in Dojo?","In a Dojo world, state is defined using models. These are structs marked with the #[derive(Model)] attribute, functioning similarly to a key-pair store. The primary key for a model is indicated using the #[key] attribute; for instance, the player field serves as the primary key in this context."
"what does self.world_dispatcher do in the context of Dojo?","self.world_dispatcher. This provides a gateway to the world contract. This facilitates the effortless utilization of the get! and set! commands, allowing seamless interaction with the world contract."
"Give a sample contract that spawns a player, using Dojo","use starknet::ContractAddress;

// dojo data models
#[derive(Model, Copy, Drop, Serde)]
struct Position {
    #[key] // primary key
    player: ContractAddress,
    vec: Vec2,
}

// regular cairo struct
#[derive(Copy, Drop, Serde, Introspect)]
struct Vec2 {
    x: u32,
    y: u32
}

// interface
#[starknet::interface]
trait IPlayerActions<TContractState> {
    fn spawn(self: @TContractState);
}

// contract
#[dojo::contract]
mod player_actions {
    use starknet::{ContractAddress, get_caller_address};
    use super::{Position, Vec2};
    use super::IPlayerActions;

    #[external(v0)]
    impl PlayerActionsImpl of IPlayerActions<ContractState> {
        //
        // This is how we interact with the world contract.
        //
        fn spawn(self: @ContractState) {
            // Access the world dispatcher for reading.
            let world = self.world_dispatcher.read();

            // get player address
            let player = get_caller_address();

            // dojo command - get player position
            let position = get!(world, player, (Position));

            // dojo command - set player position
            set!(world, (Position { player, vec: Vec2 { x: 10, y: 10 } }));
        }
    }
}"
"Can you explain how Dojo interacts with Cairo?","Dojo acts as an abstraction layer over Cairo, offering developers simplified commands that are expanded into complex queries at the time of compilation."
"What constitutes the structure of Dojo?","In Dojo's structure, common contract templates are integrated within the compiler. This integration enables developers to concentrate on the data and logic aspects, while the compiler automatically creates the essential contracts."
"What distinguishes Dojo contracts from others?","A Dojo contract is essentially a typical Cairo contract, but it includes certain unique features specific to Dojo."
"In Dojo, how is state management implemented?","Dojo defines state through the use of models. These models are struct types flagged with the #[derive(Model)] attribute, and they operate akin to a key-value store. The primary key for a model is identified with the #[key] attribute. For example, in a given scenario, the 'player' field may act as the primary key."
"What role does self.world_dispatcher play in Dojo's framework?","self.world_dispatcher acts as a conduit to the world contract within Dojo. It streamlines the use of get! and set! commands, enabling smooth interactions with the world contract."
