What does this code do?
#[derive(Model, Drop, Serde)]
struct Moves {
    #[key]
    player: ContractAddress,
    remaining: u8,
    last_direction: Direction
}

#[derive(Copy, Drop, Serde, Introspect)]
struct Vec2 {
    x: u32,
    y: u32
}

#[derive(Model, Copy, Drop, Serde)]
struct Position {
    #[key]
    player: ContractAddress,
    vec: Vec2,
}","
For a model to be recognized, we must include Model using #[derive(Model, Drop, Serde)]. This signals to the Dojo compiler that this struct should be treated as a model.

Our Moves model houses a player field. At the same time, we have the #[key] attribute, it informs Dojo that this model is indexed by the player field. If this is unfamiliar to you, we'll clarify its importance later in the chapter. Essentially, it implies that you can query this model using the player field. Our Moves model also contains the remaining and last_direction fields

In a similar vein, we have a Position model that have a Vec2 data structure. Vec holds x and y values. Once again, this model is indexed by the player field.
"
" Please explain:
// dojo decorator
#[dojo::contract]
mod actions {
    use starknet::{ContractAddress, get_caller_address};
    use dojo_examples::models::{Position, Moves, Direction, Vec2};
    use dojo_examples::utils::next_position;
    use super::IActions;

    // declaring custom event struct
    #[event]
    #[derive(Drop, starknet::Event)]
    enum Event {
        Moved: Moved,
    }

    // declaring custom event struct
    #[derive(Drop, starknet::Event)]
    struct Moved {
        player: ContractAddress,
        direction: Direction
    }

    // impl: implement functions specified in trait
    #[external(v0)]
    impl ActionsImpl of IActions<ContractState> {
        // ContractState is defined by system decorator expansion
        fn spawn(self: @ContractState) {
            // Access the world dispatcher for reading.
            let world = self.world_dispatcher.read();

            // Get the address of the current caller, possibly the player's address.
            let player = get_caller_address();

            // Retrieve the player's current position from the world.
            let position = get!(world, player, (Position));

            // Retrieve the player's move data, e.g., how many moves they have left.
            let moves = get!(world, player, (Moves));

            // Update the world state with the new data.
            // 1. Increase the player's remaining moves by 10.
            // 2. Move the player's position 10 units in both the x and y direction.
            set!(
                world,
                (
                    Moves {
                        player, remaining: moves.remaining + 10, last_direction: Direction::None
                    },
                    Position {
                        player, vec: Vec2 { x: position.vec.x + 10, y: position.vec.y + 10 }
                    },
                )
            );
        }

        // Implementation of the move function for the ContractState struct.
        fn move(self: @ContractState, direction: Direction) {
            // Access the world dispatcher for reading.
            let world = self.world_dispatcher.read();

            // Get the address of the current caller, possibly the player's address.
            let player = get_caller_address();

            // Retrieve the player's current position and moves data from the world.
            let (mut position, mut moves) = get!(world, player, (Position, Moves));

            // Deduct one from the player's remaining moves.
            moves.remaining -= 1;

            // Update the last direction the player moved in.
            moves.last_direction = direction;

            // Calculate the player's next position based on the provided direction.
            let next = next_position(position, direction);

            // Update the world state with the new moves data and position.
            set!(world, (moves, next));

            // Emit an event to the world to notify about the player's move.
            emit!(world, Moved { player, direction });
        }
    }
}","
As you can see a System is like a regular function of a dojo(starknet) contract. It imports the Models we defined earlier and exposes two functions spawn and move. These functions are called when a player spawns into the world and when they move respectively.

// Retrieve the player's current position from the world.
let position = get!(world, player, (Position));

// Retrieve the player's move data, e.g., how many moves they have left.
let moves = get!(world, player, (Moves));
Here we use get! command to retrieve the Position and Moves model for the player entity, which is the address of the caller.

Now the next line:

// Update the world state with the new data.
// 1. Increase the player's remaining moves by 10.
// 2. Move the player's position 10 units in both the x and y direction.
set!(
    world,
    (
        Moves {
            player, remaining: moves.remaining + 10, last_direction: Direction::None
        },
        Position {
            player, vec: Vec2 { x: position.vec.x + 10, y: position.vec.y + 10}
        },
    )
);
Here we use the set! command to set the Moves and Position models for the player entity.
