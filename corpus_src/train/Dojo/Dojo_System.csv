"Dojo Systems play a pivotal role in your world's logic, directly mutating its component states.","To enact these mutations, a system needs explicit permission from the models owner."
"Dojo System Permissions?","Since the whole contract is given write access to the model, it is important to be careful when defining systems."
"Dojo System Structure?","Every system function starts with a world address as its initial parameter. This design permits these functions to alter the world's state."
"What is the role of Systems in Dojo?","Systems are functions within a Dojo Contract that act on the world and directly mutate its component states."

System is a function in a contract
As you can see a System is like a regular function of a Starknet contract. This contract can include storage, and it can implement interfaces.

Spawn function
The spawn function is currently the only system that exists in this contract. It is called when a player spawns into the world. It is responsible for setting up the player's initial state.
