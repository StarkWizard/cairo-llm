System is a function in a contract
As you can see a System is like a regular function of a Starknet contract. This contract can include storage, and it can implement interfaces.

Spawn function
The spawn function is currently the only system that exists in this contract. It is called when a player spawns into the world. It is responsible for setting up the player's initial state.
