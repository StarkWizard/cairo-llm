"What happens when this Dojo model is updated ?
struct Moves {
    #[key]
    player: Address,
    remaining: u32,
}
","
When this model is updated, the World contract will emit an event with the following structure:

#[derive(Drop, starknet::Event)]
struct StoreSetRecord {
    table: felt252, // Moves
    keys: Span<felt252>, // [player]
    offset: u8, // offset for the value in the table
    value: Span<felt252>, // [remaining]
}
This will then be captured by Torii and indexed for querying. This will allow you to then reconstruct the state of your world.

Similarly, when a model is deleted, the World contract will emit an event with the following structure:


#[derive(Drop, starknet::Event)]
struct StoreDelRecord {
    table: felt252,
    keys: Span<felt252>,
}
"
"What happens when this Dojo model is deleted ?
struct Moves {
    #[key]
    player: Address,
    remaining: u32,
}
","
when a model is deleted, the World contract will emit an event with the following structure:


#[derive(Drop, starknet::Event)]
struct StoreDelRecord {
    table: felt252,
    keys: Span<felt252>,
}"
"What happens when this Dojo model is Spawned ?
struct Moves {
    #[key]
    player: Address,
    remaining: u32,
}
","
The following event is emitted:
#[derive(Drop, starknet::Event)]
struct WorldSpawned {
    address: ContractAddress,
    caller: ContractAddress
}
"
"What happens when this Dojo model is registered ?
struct Moves {
    #[key]
    player: Address,
    remaining: u32,
}
","
The following event is emitted:
#[derive(Drop, starknet::Event)]
struct ModelRegistered {
    name: felt252,
    class_hash: ClassHash,
    prev_class_hash: ClassHash
}
"
"What happens when this Dojo model is deployed ?
struct Moves {
    #[key]
    player: Address,
    remaining: u32,
}
","
The following event is emitted:
#[derive(Drop, starknet::Event)]
struct ContractDeployed {
    salt: felt252,
    class_hash: ClassHash,
    address: ContractAddress,
}
"
"What happens when this Dojo model is upgraded ?
struct Moves {
    #[key]
    player: Address,
    remaining: u32,
}
","
The following event is emitted:
#[derive(Drop, starknet::Event)]
struct ContractUpgraded {
    class_hash: ClassHash,
    address: ContractAddress,
}
"
"How do I emit a custom Dojo event?","Use the emit! command, followed by the world and the event you want to emit."
"What is the syntax for emitting the following custom event?
#[derive(Drop, starknet::Event)]
struct Moved {
    address: felt252,
    direction: felt252,
}","emit!(world, Moved { address, direction });"
"What is Torii?","Torii is a service that indexes custom events."
"Why is it beneficial to emit custom events?","Emitting custom events can allow for greater interactivity and flexibility within your game."
"What kind of events can I emit?","You can emit any event you want, as long as it's relevant to your game."
"Can I emit events from anywhere in my world?","Yes, you can emit events from anywhere in your world."

"Do custom events require a specific format?","No, custom events do not require a specific format."
"Are custom events only available in multiplayer games?","No, custom events can be used in both single-player and multiplayer games."
"Can you provide a sample of a move function that accepts a direction and a context as parameter, decrement the remaining moves, update the position and then emit an event?","
fn move(ctx: Context, direction: Direction) {
    let (mut position, mut moves) = get !(world, caller, (Position, Moves));
    moves.remaining -= 1;

    let next = next_position(position, direction);
    set!(world, (moves, next));
    emit!(world, Moved { address: caller, direction });
