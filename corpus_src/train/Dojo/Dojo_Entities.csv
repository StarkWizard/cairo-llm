How do you define in Dojo an entity of a character in a game that has a Moves and a Position model
","

When defining the models for this entity, it is important to note that we do not reference the entity directly. Instead, we simply provide two structs that the entity will contain.

#[derive(Models, Drop, Serde)]
struct Moves {
    #[key]
    player: ContractAddress,
    remaining: u8,
}

#[derive(Models, Drop, Serde)]
struct Health {
    #[key]
    player: ContractAddress,
    x: u32,
    y: u32
}
