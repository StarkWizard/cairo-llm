 "How can I get the value at a specific index of an array","
 To access array elements, you can use get() or at() array methods that return different types. Using arr.at(index) is equivalent to using the subscripting operator arr[index].

The get function returns an Option<Box<@T>>, which means it returns an option to a Box type (Cairo's smart-pointer type) containing a snapshot to the element at the specified index if that element exists in the array. If the element doesn't exist, get returns None. This method is useful when you expect to access indices that may not be within the array's bounds and want to handle such cases gracefully without panics. Snapshots will be explained in more detail in the References and Snapshots chapter.

The at function, on the other hand, directly returns a snapshot to the element at the specified index using the unbox() operator to extract the value stored in a box. If the index is out of bounds, a panic error occurs. You should only use at when you want the program to panic if the provided index is out of the array's bounds, which can prevent unexpected behavior.

In summary, use at when you want to panic on out-of-bounds access attempts, and use get when you prefer to handle such cases gracefully without panicking.

"What is a span","Span is a struct that represents a snapshot of an Array. It is designed to provide safe and controlled access to the elements of an array without modifying the original array"
"what are spans used for ?"," Span is particularly useful for ensuring data integrity and avoiding borrowing issues when passing arrays between functions or when performing read-only operations

All methods provided by Array can also be used with Span, with the exception of the append() method."
"Create a span out of an array 'array'","
```
    // To create a Span of an Array, call the span() method
    array.span()
