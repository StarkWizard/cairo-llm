question,answer
"What is Starknet?","Starknet is a Layer-2 network that makes Ethereum transactions faster, cheaper, and more secure using zk-STARKs technology. Think of it as a boosted layer on top of Ethereum, optimized for speed and cost."
"Specifically, what are the optimizations for starknet?","Starknet bridges the gap between scalability and broad consensus. It integrates a mathematical framework to navigate the balance between capacity and inclusivity. Its integrity hinges on the robustness of succinct, transparent proofs of computational integrity. This method lets powerful operators enhance Starknet's capacity, ensuring everyone can authenticate Starknet's integrity using universally accessible tools."
"What is the mission of Starknet?","Starknet mission is to allow individuals to freely implement and use any social function they desire."
"What are the core values of starknet?","Starknet ethos is anchored in core principles like: 
1.Lasting Broadness. Starknet continuously resists power consolidation.
2.Neutrality. Starknet remains impartial to the societal functions it supports.
3.Individual Empowerment. At its core, Starknet thrives on a well-informed and autonomous user base. This is achieved by fostering a culture rooted in its core mission and values, with a strong emphasis on education."
"What are the features of starknet?","These are some key features of Starknet:
1.Low Costs: Transactions on Starknet cost less than on Ethereum. Future updates like Volition and EIP 4844 will make it even cheaper.
2.Developer-Friendly: Starknet lets developers easily build decentralized apps using its native language, Cairo.
3.Speed and Efficiency: Upcoming releases aim to make transactions even faster and cheaper.
4.CVM: Thanks to Cairo, Starknet runs on its own VM, called Cairo VM (CVM), that allow us to innovate beyond the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and create a new paradigm for decentralized applications.
5.Account Abstraction: Implemented at the protocol level, this facilitates diverse signing schemes while ensuring user security and self-custody of assets.
6.Volition: Will be implemented on testnet during Q4 2023 will allow developers to regulate data availability on Ethereum (L1) or on Starknet (L2). Reducing L1 onchain data can radically reduce costs.
7.Paymaster: Starknet will allow users to choose how to pay for transaction fee, follows the guidelines laid out in EIP 4337 and allows the transaction to specify a specific contract, a Paymaster, to pay for their transaction. Supports gasless transactions, enhancing user accessibility."
"What is Cairo?","Cairo is tailor-made for creating STARK-based smart contracts. As Starknet native language, it is central to building scalable and secure decentralized apps. Inspired by Rust, Cairo lets you write contracts safely and conveniently."
"What is the relationship between 'The Starknet Foundation' and starknet?","The Starknet Foundation oversees Starknet governance. Its duties include:
1.Managing Starknet¡¯s development and operations.
2.Overseeing the Starknet DAO, which enables community involvement.
3.Setting rules to maintain network integrity."
"How can members of the foundation influence the Starknet?","Members can influence Starknet by voting on changes. Here is the process: A new version is tested on the Goerli Testnet. Members then have six days to review it. A Snapshot proposal is made, and the community votes. A majority of YES votes means an upgrade to the Mainnet."
"What is SNIP?","SNIP is short for Starknet Improvement Proposal. It is essentially a blueprint that details proposed enhancements or changes to the Starknet ecosystem. A well-crafted SNIP includes both the technical specifications of the change and the reasons behind it. If you¡¯re proposing a SNIP, it¡¯s your job to rally community support and document any objections. Once a SNIP is approved, it becomes a part of the Starknet protocol. All the SNIPs can be found in repository."
"What are the roles of SNIPs?","SNIPs serve three crucial roles:
1.They are the main avenue for proposing new features or changes.
2.They act as a platform for technical discussions within the community.
3.They document the decision-making process, offering a historical view of how Starknet has evolved."
