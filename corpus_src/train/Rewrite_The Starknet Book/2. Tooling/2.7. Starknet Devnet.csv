What is Starknet Devnet?,"Starknet Devnet is a development network (devnet) implemented in Rust, similar to the Python-based 'starknet-devnet'."
How to install Starknet Devnet on my computer?,"starknet devnet rs can be installed in two ways: using Docker or manually by cloning the repository and running it with Cargo.

1.Using Docker
To install using Docker, follow the instructions provided here.

2.Manual Installation (Cloning the Repo)
Prerequisites:

    Rust installation

Procedure:

    1.Create a new folder for the project.
    2.Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/0xSpaceShard/starknet-devnet-rs.git"
How to run Starknet Devnet?,"Run Starknet Devnet with the following command:

cargo run

On successful execution, you'll see outputs like predeployed contract addresses, account information, and seed details:

Predeployed FeeToken

Predeployed accounts using class with hash: 0x4d07e40e93398ed3c76981e72dd1fd22557a78ce36c0515f679e27f0bb5bc5f
Initial balance of each account: 1000000000000000000000 WEI
Seed to replicate this account sequence: 912753742

And there are some running options here:

1.Using a Seed

The Starknet devnet provides a 'Seed to replicate this account sequence' feature. This allows you to use a specific seed to access previously used accounts. This functionality is particularly useful when employing tools like 'sncast' or 'starkli' for contract interactions, as it eliminates the need to change account information.

To load old accounts using a specific seed, execute the following command:

cargo run -- --seed <SEED>

Example (add any number you prefer):

cargo run -- --seed 912753742

2.Dumping and Loading Data

The process of dumping and loading data facilitates resuming work from where you left off. Data can be dumped either on 'exit' or after a 'transaction'. In this example, dumping is done on exit into a specified directory. Ensure the directory exists, but not the file.

cargo run -- --dump-on exit --dump-path ./dumps/contract_1

Loading Data:

To load data, use the command below. Note that both the directory and the file created by the 'dump' command must exist. Also, pass in the seed to avoid issues like 'low account balance'.

cargo run -- --dump-path ./dumps/contract_1 --seed 912753742

Additional options:

Options:
      --accounts <ACCOUNTS>
          Specify the number of accounts to be predeployed; [default: 10]
      --account-class <ACCOUNT_CLASS>
          Specify the class used by predeployed accounts; [default: cairo0] [possible values: cairo0, cairo1]
      --account-class-custom <PATH>
          Specify the path to a Cairo Sierra artifact to be used by predeployed accounts;
  -e, --initial-balance <DECIMAL_VALUE>
          Specify the initial balance in WEI of accounts to be predeployed; [default: 1000000000000000000000]
      --seed <SEED>
          Specify the seed for randomness of accounts to be predeployed; if not provided, it is randomly generated
      --host <HOST>
          Specify the address to listen at; [default: 127.0.0.1]
      --port <PORT>
          Specify the port to listen at; [default: 5050]
      --timeout <TIMEOUT>
          Specify the server timeout in seconds; [default: 120]
      --gas-price <GAS_PRICE>
          Specify the gas price in wei per gas unit; [default: 100000000000]
      --chain-id <CHAIN_ID>
          Specify the chain ID; [default: TESTNET] [possible values: MAINNET, TESTNET]
      --dump-on <WHEN>
          Specify when to dump the state of Devnet; [possible values: exit, transaction]
      --dump-path <DUMP_PATH>
          Specify the path to dump to;
  -h, --help
          Print help
  -V, --version
          Print version

However, the main difference for the Rust version is the syntax for flags. For example, use 'cargo run -- --port 5006' or 'cargo run -- --dump-on exit ...' for the Rust Devnet. Other flags can be used in the standard format.

Cross-Version Disclaimer

Be aware that the dumping and loading functionality might not be compatible across different versions of the Devnet. In other words, data dumped from one version of Devnet may not be loadable with another version.

3.Minting Tokens:

To mint tokens, either to an existing address or a new one, use the following command:

curl -d '{'amount':8646000000000, 'address':'0x6e...eadf'}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -X POST http://localhost:5050/mint

Commands compatible with the sncast and starkli subchapters are also applicable in the Rust Devnet."
