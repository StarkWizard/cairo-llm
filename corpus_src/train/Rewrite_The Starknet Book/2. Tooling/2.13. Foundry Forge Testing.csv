What is Forge in Starknet Foundry?,"Forge sets itself apart by hosting a Cairo VM instance, enabling the sequential execution of tests. It employs Scarb for contract compilation. To utilize Forge, define test functions and label them with test attributes. Users can either test standalone Cairo functions or integrate contracts, dispatchers, and test contract interactions on-chain."
How to use Forge in Starknet Foundry?,"You can use forge through the Starknet Foundry 'snforge' command-line tool. Learn how to set up a new project, compile the code, and execute tests.

To start a new project with Starknet Foundry, use the '¡ªinit' command and replace 'project_name' with your project's name.

snforge --init project_name

Once you've set up the project, inspect its layout:

cd project_name
tree . -L 1

The project structure is as follows:

.
©À©¤©¤ README.md
©À©¤©¤ Scarb.toml
©À©¤©¤ src
©¸©¤©¤ tests

'src/' holds your contract source code.
'tests/' is the location of your test files.
'Scarb.toml' is for project and 'snforge' configurations.
Ensure the CASM code generation is active in the 'Scarb.toml' file:

# ...
[[target.starknet-contract]]
casm = true
# ...

To run tests using 'snforge':

snforge

Collected 2 test(s) from the `test_name` package
Running 0 test(s) from `src/`
Running 2 test(s) from `tests/`
[PASS] tests::test_contract::test_increase_balance
[PASS] tests::test_contract::test_cannot_increase_balance_with_zero_value
Tests: 2 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped"
How to Integrate snforge with existing Scarb Projects?,"For those with an established Scarb project who wish to incorporate 'snforge', ensure the 'snforge_std package' is declared as a dependency. Insert the line below in the [dependencies] section of your 'Scarb.toml':

# ...
[dependencies]
snforge_std = { git = 'https://github.com/foundry-rs/starknet-foundry.git', tag = '[VERSION]' }

Ensure the tag version corresponds with your 'snforge' version. To verify your 'snforge' version:

snforge ¨Cversion

Or, add this dependency using the 'scarb' command:

scarb add snforge_std --git https://github.com/foundry-rs/starknet-foundry.git --tag VERSION

With these steps, your existing Scarb project is now 'snforge'-ready."
How to test a contract with snforge?,"The example provided below demonstrates how to test a Starknet contract using 'snforge'.
///
#[starknet::interface]
trait IHelloStarknet<TContractState> {
    fn increase_balance(ref self: TContractState, amount: felt252);
    fn get_balance(self: @TContractState) -> felt252;
}

#[starknet::contract]

    #[storage]
    struct Storage {
        balance: felt252,
    }

    #[external(v0)]
    impl HelloStarknetImpl of super::IHelloStarknet<ContractState> {
        // Increases the balance by the specified amount.
        fn increase_balance(ref self: ContractState, amount: felt252) {
            self.balance.write(self.balance.read() + amount);
        }

        // Returns the balance.

        fn get_balance(self: @ContractState) -> felt252 {

Can you give me an example of how to test an ERC20 contract?,"There are several methods to test smart contracts, such as unit tests, integration tests, fuzz tests, fork tests, E2E tests, and using foundry cheatcodes. This section discusses testing an ERC20 example contract from the 'starknet-js' subchapter examples using unit and integration tests, filtering, foundry 'cheatcodes', and fuzz tests through the 'snforge' CLI.

After setting up your foundry project, add the following dependency to your 'Scarb.toml' (in this case we are using version 0.7.0 of the OpenZeppelin Cairo contracts, but you can use any version you want):

openzeppelin = { git = 'https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/cairo-contracts.git', tag = 'v0.7.0' }

Here's a basic ERC20 contract:
///
use starknet::ContractAddress;

#[starknet::interface]
trait Ierc20<TContractState> {
    fn balance_of(self: @TContractState, account: ContractAddress) -> u256;
    fn transfer(ref self: TContractState, recipient: ContractAddress, amount: u256) -> bool;
}

#[starknet::contract]
mod erc20 {
    use starknet::ContractAddress;
    use openzeppelin::token::erc20::ERC20;

    #[storage]
    struct Storage {}

    #[constructor]
    fn constructor(
        ref self: ContractState,
        initial_supply: felt252,
        recipient: ContractAddress
    ) {
        let name = 'MyToken';
        let symbol = 'MTK';

        let mut unsafe_state = ERC20::unsafe_new_contract_state();
        ERC20::InternalImpl::initializer(ref unsafe_state, name, symbol);
        ERC20::InternalImpl::_mint(ref unsafe_state, recipient, initial_supply.into());
    }

    #[external(v0)]
    impl Ierc20Impl of super::Ierc20<ContractState> {
        fn balance_of(self: @ContractState, account: ContractAddress) -> u256 {
            let unsafe_state = ERC20::unsafe_new_contract_state();
            ERC20::ERC20Impl::balance_of(@unsafe_state, account)
        }

        fn transfer(ref self: ContractState, recipient: ContractAddress, amount: u256) -> bool {
            let mut unsafe_state = ERC20::unsafe_new_contract_state();
            ERC20::ERC20Impl::transfer(ref unsafe_state, recipient, amount)
        }
    }
}
///
This contract allows minting tokens to a recipient during deployment, checking balances, and transferring tokens, relying on the openzeppelin ERC20 library.

Then, organize your test file and include the required imports:
///
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use array::ArrayTrait;
    use result::ResultTrait;
    use option::OptionTrait;
    use traits::TryInto;
    use starknet::ContractAddress;
    use starknet::Felt252TryIntoContractAddress;
    use snforge_std::{declare, ContractClassTrait};
    // Additional code here.
}
///
For testing, you'll need a helper function to deploy the contract instance. This function requires a 'supply' amount and 'recipient' address:
///
use snforge_std::{declare, ContractClassTrait};

fn deploy_contract(name: felt252) -> ContractAddress {
    let recipient = starknet::contract_address_const::<0x01>();
    let supply: felt252 = 20000000;
    let contract = declare(name);
    let mut calldata = array![supply, recipient.into()];
    contract.deploy(@calldata).unwrap()
}
// Additional code here.
///
Use 'declare' and 'ContractClassTrait' from 'snforge_std'. Then, initialize the 'supply' and 'recipient', declare the contract, compute the calldata, and deploy.

Then, verifying the Balance After Deployment. To begin, test the deployment helper function to confirm the recipient's balance:
///
    // ...
    use erc20_contract::erc20::Ierc20SafeDispatcher;
    use erc20_contract::erc20::Ierc20SafeDispatcherTrait;

    #[test]
    #[available_gas(3000000000000000)]
    fn test_balance_of() {
        let contract_address = deploy_contract('erc20');
        let safe_dispatcher = Ierc20SafeDispatcher { contract_address };
        let recipient = starknet::contract_address_const::<0x01>();
        let balance = safe_dispatcher.balance_of(recipient).unwrap();
        assert(balance == 20000000, 'Invalid Balance');
    }
///
Execute 'snforge' to verify:

Collected 1 test from erc20_contract package
[PASS] tests::test_erc20::test_balance_of

When testing smart contracts, simulating different conditions is essential. 'Foundry Cheat Codes' from the 'snforge_std' library offer these simulation capabilities for Starknet smart contracts.

These cheat codes consist of helper functions that adjust the smart contract's environment. They allow developers to modify parameters or conditions to examine contract behavior in specific scenarios.

Using 'snforge_std's cheat codes, you can change elements like block numbers, timestamps, or even the caller of a function. This guide focuses on 'start_prank' and 'stop_prank'. Below is a transfer test example:
///
    use snforge_std::{declare, ContractClassTrait, start_prank, stop_prank};

    #[test]
    #[available_gas(3000000000000000)]
    fn test_transfer() {
        let contract_address = deploy_contract('erc20');
        let safe_dispatcher = Ierc20SafeDispatcher { contract_address };

        let sender = starknet::contract_address_const::<0x01>();
        let receiver = starknet::contract_address_const::<0x02>();
        let amount : felt252 = 10000000;

        // Set the function's caller
        start_prank(contract_address, sender);
        safe_dispatcher.transfer(receiver.into(), amount.into());

        let balance_after_transfer = safe_dispatcher.balance_of(receiver).unwrap();
        assert(balance_after_transfer == 10000000, 'Incorrect Amount');

        // End the prank
        stop_prank(contract_address);
    }
///
Executing 'snforge' for the tests displays:

Collected 2 tests from erc20_contract package
[PASS] tests::test_erc20::test_balance_of
[PASS] tests::test_erc20::test_transfer

In this example, 'start_prank' determines the transfer function's caller, while 'stop_prank' concludes the prank."
What is Fuzz Test?,"Fuzz testing introduces random inputs to the code to identify vulnerabilities, security issues, and unforeseen behaviors. While you can manually provide these inputs, automation is preferable when testing a broad set of values. See the example below in 'test_fuzz.cairo':
///
    fn mul(a: felt252, b: felt252) -> felt252 {
        return a * b;
    }

    #[test]
    fn test_fuzz_sum(x: felt252, y: felt252) {
        assert(mul(x, y) == x * y, 'incorrect');
    }
///
Running 'snforge' produces:

    Collected 1 test(s) from erc20_contract package
    Running 0 test(s) from src/
    Running 1 test(s) from tests/
    [PASS] tests::test_fuzz::test_fuzz_sum (fuzzer runs = 256)
    Tests: 1 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped
    Fuzzer seed: 6375310854403272271

The fuzzer supports these types by November 2023:

u8
u16
u32
u64
u128
u256
felt252
'Fuzzer Configuration'

You can set the number of runs and the seed for a test:
///
    #[test]
    #[fuzzer(runs: 100, seed: 38)]
    fn test_fuzz_sum(x: felt252, y: felt252) {
        assert(mul(x, y) == x * y, 'incorrect');
    }
///
Or, use the command line:

    $ snforge --fuzzer-runs 500 --fuzzer-seed 4656

Or in scarb.toml:

    # ...
    [tool.snforge]
    fuzzer_runs = 500
    fuzzer_seed = 4656
    # ..."
What is Filter test?,"To execute specific tests, use a filter string with the 'snforge' command. Tests matching the filter based on their absolute module tree path will be executed.

For instance, to run all tests with the string 'test_' in their name:

snforge test_

Expected output:

    Collected 3 test(s) from erc20_contract package
    Running 0 test(s) from src/
    Running 3 test(s) from tests/
    [PASS] tests::test_erc20::tests::test_balance_of
    [PASS] tests::test_erc20::tests::test_transfer
    [PASS] tests::test_fuzz::test_fuzz_sum (fuzzer runs = 256)
    Tests: 3 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped
    Fuzzer seed: 10426315620495146768

All the tests with the string 'test_' in their test name went through.

Another example: To filter and run 'test_fuzz_sum' we can partially match the test name with the string 'fuzz_sum' like this:

snforge test_fuzz_sum

To execute an exact test, combine the '¡ªexact' flag with a fully qualified test name:

snforge package_name::test_name ¨Cexact

To halt the test suite upon the first test failure, use the '--exit-first flag':

snforge --exit-first

If a test fails, the output will resemble:

    Collected 3 test(s) from erc20_contract package
    Running 0 test(s) from src/
    Running 3 test(s) from tests/
    [FAIL] tests::test_erc20::tests::test_balance_of

    Failure data:
    original value: [381278114803728420489684244530881381], converted to a string: [Invalid Balance]

    [SKIP] tests::test_erc20::tests::test_transfer
    [SKIP] tests::test_fuzz::test_fuzz_sum
    Tests: 0 passed, 1 failed, 2 skipped

    Failures:
        tests::test_erc20::tests::test_balance_of"
