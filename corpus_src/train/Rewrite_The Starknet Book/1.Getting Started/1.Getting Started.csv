"How to use the Starknet Remix Plugin to compile, deploy and interact with smart contract?","1.Visit the Remix IDE website.
2.Navigate to the 'Plugin Manager' section in the bottom left corner.
3.Activate the 'Starknet' plugin.
4.Accept the permissions. Click 'Remember my choice' to avoid this step in the future.
5.After enabling, the Starknet logo appears on the left sidebar. Click it to interact with opened Cairo files."
Please give me a cairo contract with an ownership system.,"ok, there is a cairo example contract with ownership system:
use starknet::ContractAddress;

#[starknet::interface]
trait OwnableTrait<T> {
    fn transfer_ownership(ref self: T, new_owner: ContractAddress);
    fn get_owner(self: @T) -> ContractAddress;
}

#[starknet::contract]
mod Ownable {
    use super::ContractAddress;
    use starknet::get_caller_address;

    #[event]
    #[derive(Drop, starknet::Event)]
    enum Event {
      OwnershipTransferred1: OwnershipTransferred1,
    }

    #[derive(Drop, starknet::Event)]
    struct OwnershipTransferred1 {
        #[key]
        prev_owner: ContractAddress,
        #[key]
        new_owner: ContractAddress,
    }

    #[storage]
    struct Storage {
        owner: ContractAddress,
    }

    #[constructor]
    fn constructor(ref self: ContractState, init_owner: ContractAddress) {
        self.owner.write(init_owner);
    }

    #[abi(embed_v0)]
    impl OwnableImpl of super::OwnableTrait<ContractState> {
        fn transfer_ownership(ref self: ContractState, new_owner: ContractAddress) {
            self.only_owner();
            let prev_owner = self.owner.read();
            self.owner.write(new_owner);
            self.emit(Event::OwnershipTransferred1(OwnershipTransferred1 {
                prev_owner: prev_owner,
                new_owner: new_owner,
            }));
        }

        fn get_owner(self: @ContractState) -> ContractAddress {
            self.owner.read()
        }
    }

    #[generate_trait]
    impl PrivateMethods of PrivateMethodsTrait {
        fn only_owner(self: @ContractState) {
            let caller = get_caller_address();
            assert(caller == self.owner.read(), 'Caller is not the owner');
        }
    }
}"
what is 'starknet::ContractAddress' in your contract?,It represents a Starknet contract address and it should be added to your code to make compiler to recognize the Cairo.
what is 'OwnableTrait' in your contract?,It is the specify function for transferring and getting ownership.
what is 'OwnershipTransferred1' in your contract?,It indicates ownership change with previous and new owner details.
what is 'Storage' in your contract?,It holds the contract's state with the current owner address.
what is 'Constructor' in your contract?,It initializes the contract with a starting owner.
what are 'External Functions' in your contract?,They are functions for transferring ownership and retrieving the current owner's details.
what is 'only_owner' in your contract?,It validates if the caller is the current owner.
How to use Remix to compile your contract?,"To compile using Remix:
1.Navigate to the 'File Explorer' tab in Remix.
2.Create a new file named something.cairo and paste your code into it.
3.Choose the something.cairo file.
4.In the 'Starknet' tab, select 'Compile something.cairo'.
5.Post-compilation, an 'artifacts' folder emerges containing the compiled contract in two distinct formats: Sierra (JSON file) and CASM. For Starknet deployment, Remix will use the Sierra file. Do not worry about this process for now; we will cover it in detail in a later chapter. For now, Remix will handle the compilation and deployment for us."
How to deployment my contract?,"Here's a step-by-step guide to deploying your smart contract on the development network:
1.Select the Appropriate Network. In the Starknet tab, click on the top button and choose 'Remote Devnet' for deploying your inaugural contract on a development network.
2.Choose a Devnet Account. Under 'Devnet account selection', a list of accounts specific to the chosen devnet is presented, and pick any account and copy its address.
3.Initiating Deployment. Input some parameters if any. Then, click on 'Deploy'."
What is 'transaction_hash' on Remix terminal after deployment?,It is the unique hash of the transaction. This hash can be used to track the transaction status.
What will I get on Remix terminal after deployment?,"You will get some logs on terminal after deployment to prove you have successfully deployed the contract like:
{
  'transaction_hash': '0x275e6d2caf9bc98b47ba09fa9034668c6697160a74de89c4655e2a70be84247',
  'contract_address': '0x5eb239955ad4c4333b8ab83406a3cf5970554b60a0d8e78a531df18c59a0db9',
    ...
  'calldata': [
    '0x1398224729985f8e76571285c6d936b5af4a88206a1dc54c0658b4e15045292'
  ],
    ...
}"
What is 'contract_address' on Remix terminal after deployment?,It is the address of the deployed contract. Use this address to interact with your contract.
What is 'calldata' on Remix terminal after deployment?,It contains Some parameters fed to the constructor.
How to interact with my contract?,"1.Initiating Interaction. navigate to the 'Starknet' plugin tab and select the 'Interact' option.
2.Calling your function. Your terminal will display the result, revealing parameters during the contract deployment as calldata for the constructor."
How to know if my interaction was successful?,"The terminal logs will exhibit a 'status' variable, indicating the transaction fate. If the status reads ACCEPTED_ON_L2, the Sequencer has accepted the transaction, pending block inclusion. However, a REJECTED status signifies the Sequencer disapproval, and the transaction will not feature in the upcoming block. More often than not, this transaction gains acceptance, leading to a contract state modification."
How to create starknet account?,You can set up a smart wallet using either: Argent or Braavos.
How to use my wallet to deployment and interact with my contract?,"1.Follow the previous deployment steps.
2.In the 'Environment selection' tab, choose 'Wallet'.
3.Select your Starknet account and continue with deploying and interacting with your contract."
How can I see my transaction like hashes and parameters?,"You can monitor transaction hashes and addresses using any Starknet block explorers like:
1.Starkscan
2.Voyager
3.ViewBlock
4.oklink"
How can I learn more knowledge about starknet?,"For an extensive grasp of Starknet inner workings and potential use cases, delve into Chapter 3 of the Starknet Book. This chapter details Starknet¡¯s architectural nuances. Then go ahead from there."
