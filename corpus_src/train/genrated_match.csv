"What's a potential consequence of not making matches exhaustive in Cairo?","If matches in Cairo are not exhaustive, it could lead to cases where certain values are not handled, leading to potential errors or unintended behavior."
"How do you implement a game logic in Cairo where you win if a number is 0 and lose for all other numbers?","You can use a match expression where the first arm checks if the number is 0 and prints 'You won!'. A catch-all pattern using _ can be used for all other numbers to print 'You lost...'."
"What is the purpose of the #[derive(Drop)] attribute in the given code?","The #[derive(Drop)] attribute automatically provides an implementation of the Drop trait for the associated enum, though the specific behavior or reason for its use in this context is not detailed in the paragraph."
"How does Cairo enforce exhaustive matching in match expressions?","If you don't cover every possible case in a match expression, Cairo won't compile the code, ensuring exhaustive matching is maintained."
"How does Cairo differentiate between various enum variants in a match expression?","Cairo differentiates between various enum variants in a match expression by comparing the given value against the patterns listed in the match arms, executing the code of the first matching pattern."
"What does the keyword Some in Cairo represent?","The keyword Some in Cairo represents a variant of the Option<T> enum that indicates the presence of a value."
"How can you create a generic function to handle Option values in Cairo?","You can define a function that accepts an argument of type Option<T>, where T is a generic type parameter, allowing it to handle various types wrapped in Option."
"How do you define an enum variant that holds additional data in Cairo?","In Cairo, an enum variant that holds additional data can be defined by including the data type inside the variant. For example, Coin::Quarter(UsState)."
"How does Cairo ensure that all possible values are handled in a match expression?","Cairo ensures that all possible values are handled in a match expression by enforcing exhaustive matching, which means the code won't compile if every possible value is not addressed in the match arms."
"What is the purpose of the None variant in the Option<T> enum in Cairo?","The None variant in the Option<T> enum in Cairo represents the absence of a value."
"How do you add functionality to an existing type in Cairo?","To add functionality to an existing type in Cairo, you can use implementations, as demonstrated by implementing the print function for the appropriate PrintTrait."
"How does the drop function work for the Coin enum in the given example?","The specific behavior of the drop function for the Coin enum is not detailed in the paragraph, but the #[derive(Drop)] attribute suggests that the Coin enum has an automatically provided implementation of the Drop trait."
"How does Cairo ensure safety in its match expressions?","Cairo ensures safety in its match expressions by enforcing exhaustive matching and ensuring that all possible values are addressed."
"How do you specify a catch-all pattern in a match expression in Cairo?","In Cairo, you can specify a catch-all pattern in a match expression using the _ placeholder."
