"How can I get the caller's address of a contract","
```
    use starknet::get_caller_address;
    use starknet::ContractAddress;
    
    fn main {
        let sender_address = get_caller_address();
    }
```
You need to first declare the use of get_caller_address function and the ContractAddress type
Then call the function and store the result
"
"if I use let sender_address = get_caller_address(); what should I declare ?","
You need to first declare the use of get_caller_address function and the ContractAddress type
    use starknet::get_caller_address;
    use starknet::ContractAddress;
    
    fn main {
        let sender_address = get_caller_address();
    }
"
" Can I store the caller's address into a felt ?","
There is a dedicated type for addresses, use starknet::ContractAddress. Here is a sample:

    use starknet::get_caller_address;
    use starknet::ContractAddress;
    
    fn main {
        let sender_address = get_caller_address();
    }
"
"What type is returned by the get_caller_address function?","
The get_caller_address function returns a value of type ContractAddress. You should use this type to store the address:
    use starknet::get_caller_address;
    use starknet::ContractAddress;

    fn main() {
        let sender_address: ContractAddress = get_caller_address();
    }
"
"Do I need to import anything to use the get_caller_address function within my contract logic?","
Yes, you need to import the get_caller_address function from the starknet module, and if you plan to store the address, also import ContractAddress:
    use starknet::get_caller_address;
    use starknet::ContractAddress;

    fn main() {
        let sender_address: ContractAddress = get_caller_address();
    }
"
"How can I pass the caller's address to another function?","
You must first obtain the caller's address using get_caller_address, and then you can pass it to another function. Remember to import the necessary module:
    use starknet::get_caller_address;
    use starknet::ContractAddress;

    fn main() {
        let sender_address: ContractAddress = get_caller_address();
        pass_address(sender_address);
    }

    fn pass_address(address: ContractAddress) {
        // function logic
    }
"
"Should I use a specific type for the caller's address when defining a struct?","
Yes, when defining a struct that includes the caller's address, use the ContractAddress type for the address field:
    use starknet::ContractAddress;

    struct Transaction {
        sender_address: ContractAddress,
        // other fields
    }
"
"How to compare the caller's address with a known address?","
To compare the caller's address with a known address, you would first get the caller's address and then compare it using the == operator:
    use starknet::get_caller_address;
    use starknet::ContractAddress;

    fn is_known_sender(known_address: ContractAddress) -> bool {
        let sender_address: ContractAddress = get_caller_address();
        sender_address == known_address
    }
"
"Can the caller's address be used as a function argument?","
Yes, the caller's address can be passed as an argument to functions expecting a parameter of type ContractAddress:
    use starknet::get_caller_address;
    use starknet::ContractAddress;

    fn process_sender_action(address: ContractAddress) {
        // Function logic using the address
    }

    fn main() {
        let sender_address: ContractAddress = get_caller_address();
        process_sender_action(sender_address);
    }
"
"Can get_caller_address be used to track the activities of a user?","
Yes, get_caller_address can be used within a contract to track the activities of an address on a per-transaction basis:
    use starknet::get_caller_address;
    use starknet::ContractAddress;

    fn track_user_activity() {
        let sender_address: ContractAddress = get_caller_address();
        // Logic to record the sender's activities
    }
"
"How to ensure that a function is only called by a specific address in Cairo?","
You would use get_caller_address to retrieve the sender's address and then compare it with the specific address:
    use starknet::get_caller_address;
    use starknet::ContractAddress;

    const AUTHORIZED_SENDER: ContractAddress = /* some address */;

    fn only_authorized_sender() {
        let sender_address: ContractAddress = get_caller_address();
        assert!(sender_address == AUTHORIZED_SENDER);
        // Continue with function logic
    }
