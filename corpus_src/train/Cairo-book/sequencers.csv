a.append(10);
a.append(1);
a.append(2);

```
"
"Make an array, add two elements, assign the first to a variable","

enum Data {
    Integer(u128),
    Felt(felt252),
    Val(u32),
}

let mut messages = ArrayTrait::new();
messages.append(Data::Integer(100));
messages.append(Data::Felt('hello world'));

"Define 'Span' in Cairo","
Span is a structure representing a snapshot of an array, providing safe, controlled access to its elements without altering the original array.
"
"The purpose of spans in Cairo","
Span is used for ensuring data integrity and avoiding borrowing issues, particularly in scenarios requiring array data to be passed between functions or for read-only operations.

"
"Identify the error in 'arr[index]'","
In Cairo, the correct way to access an array value is using arr.get(index) or arr.at(index). The syntax arr[index] is not valid.
"
"Correct the code: 'myArray.pop()'","
Replace 'myArray.pop()' with 'myArray.pop_front()'. Cairo uses pop_front() for removing elements.
"

The number 1 here represents the index of the element in the array, not its address.
"
"Assign the third element of 'my_array' to 'third'","

let third = *my_array.at(2); // Assign the value at index 2 to 'third'
```
"
"Behavior of 'myArray.pop_front()'

 when the array is empty","
When 'myArray' is empty, calling 'myArray.pop_front()' will return None.
"
"Add three different values to 'scores' array","
```
scores.append(50);
scores.append(85);
scores.append(97); // Add three distinct integer values
```
"
"Insert 'hello' into the 'words' array","
```
words.append('hello'); // Append the string 'hello' to the array
```
"
"Create an array of strings with two names","
```
let mut names = ArrayTrait::new();
names.append('Alice');
names.append('Bob'); // Append two string values to the array
```
"
"Use of 'my_array.next()' to access array elements","
There's no 'next()' method for arrays in Cairo. Instead, use 'get()' or 'at()' with the appropriate index.
