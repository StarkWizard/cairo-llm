"In cairo, what is the difference between a constant and an immutable variable","
- You aren’t allowed to use mut with constants.
- Constants aren’t just immutable by default—they’re always immutable.
- You declare constants using the const keyword instead of the let keyword, and the type of the value must be annotated.
- Constants can only be declared in the global scope, which makes them useful for values that many parts of code need to know about.
- constants may be set only to a constant expression, not the result of a value that could only be computed at runtime. Only literal constants are currently supported.

Here is an example of a constant declaration:
const ONE_HOUR_IN_SECONDS: u32 = 3600;
"
"In cairo, how should I write a constant name","
Cairo's naming convention for constants is to use all uppercase with underscores between words."
"In cairo, declare a constant named toto","
```
    const TOTO:u32=0
```
"
"In cairo, declare a constant named Paul","
```
 const PAUL:u32=0
```

"
"In cairo, declare a constant named i_love_cairo","
```
    const I_LOVE_CAIRO:u32=0
```
 "
"In cairo, declare a constant named aBaB_cDe","
```
    const ABAB_CDE:u32=0
```"
"In cairo, What is the scope of a constant","
Constants are valid for the entire time a program runs, within the scope in which they were declared."
"In cairo, why are constants useful","Naming hardcoded values used throughout your program as constants is useful in conveying the meaning of that value to future maintainers of the code. It also helps to have only one place in your code you would need to change if the hardcoded value needed to be updated in the future."
"In Cairo, how should I define a constant for the maximum score allowed?","
Cairo's naming convention suggests constants should be in all uppercase letters with underscores to separate words."
"In Cairo, declare a constant for the maximum score which is 100","
    const MAX_SCORE: u32 = 100;
"
"In Cairo, how can I set a constant for a game's title?","
Follow the uppercase naming convention for constants in Cairo, using underscores for separation."
"In Cairo, declare a constant for a game's title 'Space Invaders'","
    const GAME_TITLE: felt = 'Space Invaders';
"
"In Cairo, what's the proper naming for a constant representing the maximum file size for uploads?","
Constant names in Cairo should be in uppercase with underscores between words."
"In Cairo, declare a constant for the maximum file size for uploads, say 5MB","
    const MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB: u32 = 5;
"
"In Cairo, how to write a constant that defines the color code for red?","
The convention for constants in Cairo is uppercase letters with underscores for separation."
"In Cairo, declare a constant for the color code of red which is '#FF0000'","    
const COLOR_RED_CODE: felt = '#FF0000';
"
"What is the syntax for declaring a constant?","const <constant_name>: <type> = <value>"
"What is the scope of a constant?","Global scope"
"What are the allowed values for constants?","Only literal constants are currently supported."
"What are some examples of use cases for constants?","Maximum number of points a player can earn in a game, speed of light."
"What is the naming convention for constants?","All uppercase with underscores between words."
"How long are constants valid for?","Entire time a program runs, within the scope in which they were declared."
"Why is it useful to declare constants?","It helps convey the meaning of the value to future maintainers of the code.
It allows for easy updates of hardcoded values in the future."
"What is the difference between mut and const?","mut allows you to change the value of a variable, while const does not."
"What is the difference between a constant and a variable?","A constant is immutable, while a variable is mutable."
"What keyword is used to declare a constant?","const"
"What keyword is used to declare a variable?","let"
"Do constants need to have their types annotated?","Yes"
"Do variables need to have their types annotated?","No"
"What is the difference between constants and variables","Constants are immutable values that cannot be changed, while variables can be changed. Constants are declared using the const keyword, while variables are declared using the let keyword. Constants must be annotated with a type, while variables do not."
"Why are constants useful","Constants are useful because they can be used to represent values that are constant throughout the program, such as the maximum number of points a player can earn in a game. Constants can also help to improve the readability of your code by making it clear what values are not expected to change."
"How are constants declared","Constants are declared using the const keyword followed by the name of the constant, an equals sign (=), and the value of the constant. The type of the constant must be annotated."
"What is the difference between constants and immutable variables","Constants are always immutable, while immutable variables can be made mutable by using the mut keyword."
"Where can constants be declared","Constants can only be declared in the global scope."
"What is the Cairo's naming convention for constants","Cairo's naming convention for constants is to use all uppercase with underscores between words."
"Why should constants be used instead of hardcoded values","Constants should be used instead of hardcoded values to improve the readability of your code, to make it easier to change the value of a constant if necessary, and to avoid accidentally changing a constant."
"What is a constant expression","A constant expression is an expression that can be evaluated at compile time."
"What are literal constants","Literal constants are values that are written directly in the code, such as 10, 'hello', or true."
"What is the use of constants in a program","Constants are used to represent values that are not expected to change during the execution of a program."
"When should you use constants","You should use constants when you need to represent a value that is not expected to change, such as the maximum number of points a player can earn in a game."
"What are the advantages of using constants","The advantages of using constants include improved readability, easier maintenance, and increased security."
"What are the disadvantages of using constants","The disadvantages of using constants include the inability to change the value of a constant at runtime and the need to declare constants in the global scope."
"What is the syntax for declaring a constant in Cairo","To declare a constant in Cairo, you use the const keyword followed by the name of the constant, an equals sign (=), and the value of the constant. The type of the constant must be annotated."
"What is the difference between const and static in Cairo","The const keyword is used to declare constants, while the static keyword is used to declare static variables. Constants are immutable, while static variables are mutable."
"What is the scope of a constant in Cairo","The scope of a constant in Cairo is the entire program."
"Can constants be used in expressions in Cairo","Yes, constants can be used in expressions in Cairo."
"What is the difference between a constant and a variable in Cairo","A constant is an immutable value, while a variable is a mutable value."
"What is the difference between a constant and a macro in Cairo","A constant is a value that is known at compile time, while a macro is a code template that is expanded at compile time."
"What is the difference between a constant and an enum in Cairo","A constant is a value that is known at compile time, while an enum is a type that represents a set of possible values."
