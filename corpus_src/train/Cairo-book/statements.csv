"How do you define a function in Cairo?","To define a function in Cairo, you use the fn keyword followed by the function name, the parameter list, the return type (if any), and the function body enclosed in curly brackets."
"How do you call a function in Cairo?","To call a function in Cairo, you simply use the function name followed by the arguments enclosed in parentheses."
"What is a return value in Cairo?","A return value is the value that a function returns to the caller when it finishes executing."

"What is the unit value in Cairo?","The unit value in Cairo is a special value that represents the absence of a value. It is often used as the return value of functions that do not need to return a specific value."
"Why is the unit value useful in Cairo?","The unit value is useful in Cairo because it allows functions to be used in contexts where a return value is not required, such as in event handlers or as the last expression in a block."
"Can you assign the result of a function call to a variable in Cairo?","Yes, you can assign the result of a function call to a variable in Cairo. For example, let x = add(5, 6); assigns the result of the add function call to the variable x."
"What is the difference between a variable and a constant in Cairo?","A variable is a named location in memory that can store a value that can be changed, while a constant is a named location in memory that stores a value that cannot be changed."

"What is the purpose of a semicolon at the end of a statement in Cairo?","A semicolon at the end of a statement terminates and executes the statement, allowing multiple statements to be written on the same line."
"What is the significance of curly braces in Cairo?","Curly braces are used to enclose blocks of code, creating a new scope or grouping related statements together."
