"division in Cairo ?","In Cairo, the result of x/y is defined to always satisfy the equation (x / y) * y == x. If y divides x as integers, you will get the expected result in Cairo (for example 6 / 2 will indeed result in 3). But when y does not divide x, you may get a surprising result: For example, since 2 * ((P+1)/2) = P+1 â‰¡ 1 mod[P], the value of 1 / 2 in Cairo is (P+1)/2 (and not 0 or 0.5), as it satisfies the above equation.

"add 1 to i"," 
```
    i+=1;
```
"
"How can I reverse a boolean state with a single operator?","
Use the ! operator to toggle a boolean value:
    let mut state = true;
    state = !state; // state is now false
"
"What do I use if I want to check that two variables are not the same?","
You can use the != operator to compare two variables for non-equality:

    let a = 5;
    let b = 10;
    let result = a != b; // result is true because a is not equal to b
"
"How can I find the remainder of an integer division?","
Use the % operator to get the remainder of integer division:
   let dividend = 7;
    let divisor = 3;
    let remainder = dividend % divisor; // remainder is 1
"
"If I want to update a variable with its remainder after division, what should I do?","
You can use the %= operator to divide and assign the remainder to the variable:

    let mut number = 10;
    number %= 3; // number is now 1
"
"Can I combine two boolean conditions, but only evaluate the second if the first is true?","
Yes, you can use the && operator for short-circuiting logical AND:
   let first_condition = true;
    let second_condition = false;

    if first_condition && second_condition {
        // This block will not execute because second_condition is false
    }
"
"How do I multiply two numbers and update the first variable with the result?","
You can use the *= operator for multiplication and assignment:
 let mut a = 5;
    a *= 2; // a is now 10
"
"What does dereferencing a pointer or reference in Cairo mean?","
Dereferencing is done using the * operator before a pointer or reference, which allows you to access the value that the pointer points to:
    let reference = &42;
    let value = *reference; // Dereferencing to get the value 42
"
"How can I add two values together?","
Use the + operator to perform arithmetic addition:

    let sum = 5 + 10; // sum is 15
"
"How do I use the comma , in function calls?","
The comma , separates arguments in a function call, or elements in arrays and tuples:

    fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
        a + b
    }

    let result = add(1, 2); // Calling add with two arguments
"
"What operator do I use for arithmetic negation?","
Use the - operator to negate a numerical value:

   let positive = 5;
   let negative = -positive; // negative is -5
"
"How can I subtract one variable from another and store the result back in the first variable?","
Use the -= operator to subtract and assign:
   let mut a = 10;
   a -= 5; // a is now 5
"
"How do I indicate the return type of a function?","
Use the -> followed by the type after the function parameters to specify the return type:
   fn give_number() -> i32 {
        42
    }
"
"How can I access a member of a struct?","
Use the . operator to access a member of a struct:
    struct Point {
        x: i32,
        y: i32,
    }

    let p = Point { x: 10, y: 20 };
    let x_coord = p.x; // Accessing the x member
"
"What is the correct way to divide two numbers?","
Use the / operator for arithmetic division:

    let quotient = 10 / 5; // quotient is 2
"
"What is the role of the colon : in type declarations?","
The colon : is used in type declarations to specify the type of a variable or the type of a pattern in pattern matching:

    let x: i32 = 5;
"
"What does a semicolon ; signify in Cairo?","
A semicolon ; is used to terminate statements and expressions, indicating the end of an instruction:
    let a = 5;
    let b = a + 1; // Semicolon marks the end of the statement
"
"how do you write a less-than comparison?","
You can use the < operator for a less-than comparison:

    let is_smaller = 5 < 10; // is_smaller is true
"
"What is the => symbol used for in match expressions?","
The => connects the pattern to the code to execute in a match arm:

    match number {
        1 => println!('One'),
        2 => println!('Two'),
        _ => println!('Something else'),
    }
"
"How can I check for greater than or equal in a condition?","
Use the >= operator for greater than or equal to comparison:

    let is_greater_or_equal = 10 >= 5; // is_greater_or_equal is true
"
"What is the use of the caret ^ ?","
The caret ^ is used for bitwise exclusive OR (XOR) operations:

    let result = 0b1010 ^ 0b1100; // result is 0b0110
"
"How do I perform a logical OR that evaluates both conditions no matter what?","
Use the || operator for logical OR, but keep in mind that unlike &&, || does not short-circuit if the first operand is true:

    let first_condition = false;
    let second_condition = true;

    if first_condition || second_condition {
        // This block will execute because second_condition is true
    }
