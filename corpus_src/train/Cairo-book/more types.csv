"What is the significance of an empty tuple in Cairo?","
An empty tuple, or unit (), represents a value and type that signifies the absence of any value or can be used as a placeholder where a value is needed syntactically but not semantically:

fn return_unit() -> () {
        // Function logic
        return (); // Explicitly returning 'unit'
    }
"
"What does the notation (expr,) represent in Cairo?","
The notation (expr,) represents a single-element tuple expression. It is used to create a tuple with only one element, which is distinguished from just the value by the trailing comma:

    fn get_single_element_tuple() -> (u32,) {
        let single_tuple: (u32,) = (5,);
        return single_tuple;
    }
"
"How do you define a type for a single-element tuple in Cairo?","
You define a type for a single-element tuple in Cairo by specifying the type of the single element followed by a comma within parentheses:

   fn type_single_element_tuple() -> (u32,) {
        // This function must return a single-element tuple of type u32
        return (42,); // Correctly returning a single-element tuple
    }
"
"How do you write a tuple expression with multiple values in Cairo?","
A tuple expression with multiple values is written by enclosing the values in parentheses, separated by commas:

    fn get_multi_value_tuple() -> (u32, bool, felt) {
        let multi_value_tuple: (u32, bool, felt) = (10, true, 12345);
        return multi_value_tuple;
    }
"
"How do you call a function with a tuple containing multiple arguments in Cairo?","
You call a function with a tuple containing multiple arguments by passing the arguments within parentheses as part of the function call:

    fn process_values(value1: u32, value2: bool) {
        // Function logic
    }

    fn main() {
        let my_values: (u32, bool) = (5, true);
        process_values(my_values); // Calling the function with a tuple
    }
"
"How are tuples used to initialize structs or enums in Cairo?","
Tuples can be used to initialize tuple structs or tuple enum variants by providing the values as a tuple expression:

    struct MyTupleStruct(u32, bool);

    enum MyEnum {
        Variant1(u32, bool),
    }

    fn create_struct_and_enum() {
        let my_struct = MyTupleStruct(10, true); // Initializing a tuple struct
        let my_enum = MyEnum::Variant1(20, false); // Initializing a tuple enum variant
        // Further logic
    }
