"How does inference work with Cairo's ownership system?","Inference works seamlessly with Cairo's ownership system, inferring types while respecting ownership rules."
"Does Cairo's compiler provide feedback on inferred types?","Yes, Cairo's compiler can provide feedback on inferred types during compilation."

"Is the compiler's search for an impl limited to the current scope?","No, it includes multiple locations."
"What is the importance of the defining module in the compiler's search?","It's a key location where the impl might be found."
"Can a user avoid compiler errors by specifying the impl name?","Yes."
"Is it necessary for a user to know where a trait's generic argument is defined?","Yes, for understanding where the impl might be located."
"Are all possible locations for an impl external to the current scope?","No, some are within the current scope."
"Why is the module where usize is defined relevant in the example?","Because it's a generic argument of the Display trait."
