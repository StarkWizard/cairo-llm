question,answer
"What is the main purpose of understanding Starknet's transaction types?","To master its architecture and capabilities."
"What is central to Starknet's functionality?","The Starknet Operating System (OS)."
"What does the Starknet OS orchestrate?","Deploying contracts, executing transactions, and facilitating L1<>L2 message exchanges."
"What does 'protocol level' refer to in Starknet?","Modifications in the foundational Starknet OS Cairo program."
"What is unique about Declare Transactions in Starknet?","They introduce new classes, leading to potential new smart contracts."
"What is the limitation of Invoke Transactions?","They can call upon an action but can't introduce new ones."
"What are Deploy Account Transactions designed for?","Setting up smart wallet contracts."
"What is the sole mechanism for introducing new smart contracts to Starknet?","Declare transactions."
"How do Declare transactions in Starknet compare to programming in C++?","Similar to declaring a variable or function before using it."
"What is the purpose of V0 in Starknet?","Suited for Cairo 0 contracts before nonces."
"What is the specialty of V1 in Starknet?","Tailored for Cairo 0 with nonces."
"What is significant about V2 in Starknet?","Optimized for modern Cairo contracts."
"How did developers send code to the sequencer in Cairo 0?","They sent Cairo Assembly (CASM) code directly."
"What is the major difference in how code is sent in the contemporary Cairo version?","Developers send Sierra code to the Sequencer."
"What is the compilation process in the current Cairo version?","Compiles to Sierra, which then compiles to CASM."
"Why are Sierra executions considered infallible in Starknet?","They are always provable, unlike in Cairo 0."
"What happens if transactions fail in Cairo 0?","They become non-provable."
"What does declaring a contract with the latest version in Starknet involve?","Announcing Sierra code, not just raw CASM."
"What do the parameters of a V2 transaction ensure?","That the class hash corresponds to the Sierra code being dispatched."
"What does the class hash encompass in Starknet?","The hash of the Cairo assembly code."
"Why is it important that the dispatched code aligns with the indicated class hash?","To ensure the legitimacy of the code."
"What implication does using the most recent Cairo version have?","Utilization of the latest Declare transaction version."
"How do Invoke transactions differ from Declare transactions?","Invoke transactions donâ€™t add new functions but carry out actions."
"How does Starknet's method of deploying contracts contrast with Ethereum?","Starknet uses only the method of having another smart contract factory deploy contracts."
"What does the Universal Deployer Contract (UDC) in Starknet do?","Helps deploy contracts."
"How is invoking a function in Starknet similar to C++?","Like calling a declared function to perform tasks."
"What are the two stages every Invoke transaction in Starknet undergoes?","validate and execute."
"What does the validate step in an Invoke transaction do?","Checks the transaction's correctness."
"What happens during the execute phase of an Invoke transaction?","The transaction is processed."
"What does Starknet's transaction strategy focus on?","Utilizing existing functionalities."
"What challenge does Deploy Account Transactions address?","Setting up accounts without having one already."
"How does Starknet handle deployment fees for the first smart wallet contract?","Through deploy account transactions."
"Can addresses in Starknet accept funds without an associated smart wallet?","Yes."
"What does the validate function check before an account is created in Starknet?","If the proposed deployment address has sufficient funds."
"What ensures the legitimacy and financial readiness of a new account in Starknet?","The method of checking funds during the validate step."
"Why are Declare transactions important in Starknet?","For presenting new functions."
"How can developers relate to the process of Declare transactions in Starknet?","By likening it to C++ declarations."
"What is the primary focus of Starknet's transaction types?","Facilitating different aspects of network operation."
