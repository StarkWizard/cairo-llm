Why does this progam makes an error ?

use debug::PrintTrait;

struct Rectangle {
    width: u64,
    height: u64,
}

fn main() {
    let rectangle = Rectangle { width: 30, height: 10, };
    rectangle.print();
}","

You need to implement the PrintTrait for Rectangle.
Here is an example of how to do it:
```
use debug::PrintTrait;

struct Rectangle {
    width: u64,
    height: u64,
}

fn main() {
    let rectangle = Rectangle { width: 30, height: 10, };
    rectangle.print();
}

impl RectanglePrintImpl of PrintTrait<Rectangle> {
    fn print(self: Rectangle) {
        self.width.print();
        self.height.print();
    }
}
```

"Why does this program produce an error when trying to print a tuple in cairo?

use debug::PrintTrait;

fn main() {
    let point = (10, 20);
    point.print();
}
","
You can't directly print a tuple. You need to implement PrintTrait or print each element separately.
Here is how you can print each element:
use debug::PrintTrait;

fn main() {
    let point = (10, 20);
    point.0.print();  // prints the first element of the tuple
    point.1.print();  // prints the second element of the tuple
}
"
"What's the problem with printing a custom struct directly in cairo?
use debug::PrintTrait;

struct Point {
    x: i64,
    y: i64,
}

fn main() {
    let my_point = Point { x: 10, y: 20 };
    my_point.print();
}
","
The PrintTrait is not implemented for the Point struct. You need to manually implement it.
Here is an example:
use debug::PrintTrait;

struct Point {
    x: i64,
    y: i64,
}

impl PointPrintImpl of PrintTrait<Point> {
    fn print(self: Point) {
        self.x.print();
        self.y.print();
    }
}

fn main() {
    let my_point = Point { x: 10, y: 20 };
    my_point.print();
}

"Why won't this code compile when attempting to print a custom enum variant in cairo?
use debug::PrintTrait;

enum Direction {
    North,
    South,
    East,
    West,
}

fn main() {
    let my_direction = Direction::North;
    my_direction.print();
}
","
Enums in Cairo can't be printed without implementing the PrintTrait for each variant.
Here is a corrected version:

use debug::PrintTrait;

enum Direction {
    North,
    South,
    East,
    West,
}

impl DirectionPrintImpl of PrintTrait<Direction> {
    fn print(self: Direction) {
        match self {
            Direction::North => 'North'.print(),
            Direction::South => 'South'.print(),
            Direction::East => 'East'.print(),
            Direction::West => 'West'.print(),
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let my_direction = Direction::North;
    my_direction.print();
}

"How can I handle optional return values in Cairo smart contracts?","
To handle optional return values in Cairo, you should use the OptionTrait like this:

    use core::option::OptionTrait;

    fn some_function() -> Option<u128> {
        // ... function logic
        if condition_is_met {
            Some(return_value)
        } else {
            None
        }
    }
The OptionTrait provides methods such as is_some(), is_none(), and unwrap() to work with optional values.
"
"What is a ResultTrait and when should I use it in Cairo?","
ResultTrait is used to return and propagate errors in Cairo smart contracts. Here's how you can use it:

    use core::result::ResultTrait;

    fn another_function() -> Result<u128, SomeErrorType> {
        // ... function logic
        if error_condition {
            Err(some_error)
        } else {
            Ok(successful_value)
        }
    }
You should use ResultTrait when you need to handle the possibility of an error occurring during the execution of a function.
"
"How do I declare a smart contract's address in Cairo using a type-safe method?","
To declare a smart contract's address in Cairo using a type-safe method, you can use ContractAddress type as follows:

    use starknet::ContractAddress;

    const SOME_CONTRACT_ADDRESS: ContractAddress = contract_address_const!(0x0123456789abcdef);

This ensures that the address is of the correct type for use within the smart contract.
"
"What is the purpose of the ContractAddressZeroable trait?","
ContractAddressZeroable is used to determine if a ContractAddress type value is zero or not. Here's an example of its use:

    use starknet::contract_address::ContractAddressZeroable;
    use starknet::ContractAddress;

    fn is_address_zero(address: ContractAddress) -> bool {
        address.is_zero()
    }
This trait is useful when you need to check if an address is set to a default or null-like value.
"
"How can I create a constant contract address in Cairo?","
You can create a constant contract address in Cairo with the contract_address_const! macro like this:

    use starknet::contract_address_const;

    const KNOWN_CONTRACT_ADDRESS: ContractAddress = contract_address_const!(0x0123456789abcdef);
This is useful for when you need to work with known contract addresses that will not change.
"
"What is the Into trait and how can I use it in Cairo?","
The Into trait is used for converting one type into another. In Cairo, you can use it as follows:

    use traits::Into;

    fn convert_type<T, S: Into<T>>(value: S) -> T {
        value.into()
    }
This trait simplifies type conversion in your smart contract code.
"
"Can you give me an example of using TryInto in a Cairo contract?","
Certainly! Here’s how you might use TryInto:

    use traits::TryInto;

    fn try_convert_type<T, S: TryInto<T>>(value: S) -> Result<T, S::Error> {
        value.try_into()
    }
Use TryInto when the conversion might fail and you need to handle the possibility of an error.
"
"What is the get_caller_address function used for in Cairo contracts?","
The get_caller_address function is used to obtain the address of the entity that called the contract function:

    use starknet::get_caller_address;

    fn get_sender() -> ContractAddress {
        get_caller_address()
    }
It is commonly used for authorization checks.
"
"How can I obtain the current contract's address within the contract code?","
You can obtain the current contract’s address with the get_contract_address function:

    use starknet::info::get_contract_address;

    fn get_own_address() -> ContractAddress {
        get_contract_address()
    }
This is useful for contracts that need to pass their own address as a reference or for logging purposes.
"
"What should I be aware of when importing multiple traits or functions into a Cairo contract module?","
When importing multiple traits or functions, ensure there are no naming conflicts and that each import is used according to its purpose:

    // Import multiple traits
    use core::option::OptionTrait;
    use core::result::ResultTrait;

    // Import functions
    use starknet::get_caller_address;
    use starknet::info::get_contract_address;

    // Contract code utilizing the imported traits and functions
You should also manage the namespace effectively to keep your code clean and readable.
