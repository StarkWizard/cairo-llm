"where are storage variables stored","storage variables are saved on chain"
"is there a way to save a contract state","Cairo supports contract state variables using storage. They will be recorded on chain."
"How many storage structure can I define","There can be at most one Storage structure per contract, but you can add as many components to the storage structure, as you need."
"declare three storage variables","#
```
    [storage]
    struct Storage{
        var_felt: felt252,
        var_bool: bool,
        var_uint: u8,
    }

"How do I set a state in storage","
```
    myContractState.myState.write(myValue)
```

"How do I set a state in storage","
```
    myContractState.myState.read()
```

" Can I see the variable stored in the Storage in the ABI ?","
No, it is kept ptrivate, you need to write functions in your contract to access the variables.

Write a contract that stores a counter per caller's address. A user can get, reset, increment, decrement the counter. Add detailed comments

    // Core Library imports

    use starknet::ContractAddress;

    // Storage
    // Storage is not visible by default through the ABI

    struct Storage {
        // This variable is a LegacyMap. It is equivalent to a mapping in Solidity.
        // It is used to store a counter (of type u128) for each user address (of type ContractAddress) in the contract's storage
        // The user_counters variable is private and can only be accessed through the getter function declared below
        // To read the u128 value from a LegacyMap, use the read function (e.g. user_counters::read(sender_address))
        // To write a u128 value to a LegacyMap (mapping a u128 to a ContractAddress), use the write function (e.g. user_counters::write(sender_address, 0_u128))
        user_counters: LegacyMap::<ContractAddress, u128>,
