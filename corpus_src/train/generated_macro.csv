"How do you append a value to an array in Cairo?","You use the 'append' method, as in 'arr.append(value);'."
"How does the array! macro differ from traditional array declaration and initialization in Cairo based on the provided examples?","The array! macro combines the declaration and initialization steps into one, whereas traditionally you would declare the array and then append each value one by one."
"Can you infer if 'consteval_int!' is the only way to declare a constant in Cairo ?","No, see 'consteval_int!' as a way to declare a constant that is the result of a computation of integers at compile time, but it doesn't state if it's the only way to declare constants in Cairo."
"What might be a use-case for 'consteval_int!' based on the provided information?","A use-case for 'consteval_int!' might be when a developer needs to declare a constant that is the result of a computation of integers and wants its value determined at compile time."
"From the provided information, can you deduce if macros in Cairo produce runtime code?","Based on the provided information, the macros in Cairo produce or interpret code at compile time, not runtime."
