        return 1;
    }
```

"set a to 5 if b=1 otherwise a to 6","
 ```   
    if b == 1 {
        a = 5;
    }
    else
    {
        a=6;
    }

    or 

    a=6;
    if b == 1 {
        a = 1;
    }

    or
    
    a = if b==1 {

"If you come across an if statement in code like if x > 10 { increment_counter() } else { reset_counter() }, what code runs if x is 11?","
In the code structure:

    if x > 10 {
        increment_counter();
    } else {
        reset_counter();
    }

increment_counter() is executed when x is greater than 10, so it runs if x is 11."
"What code is executed in a construct like if temperature < 0 { display_freezing_message() } else { display_warm_message() } when the temperature is -5 degrees?","
In the structure:
    if temperature < 0 {
        display_freezing_message();
    } else {
        display_warm_message();
    }
display_freezing_message() is executed since the temperature is less than 0 degrees."
"How does an if construct behave in a scenario like if isConnected { send_data() } else { show_error() } when isConnected is false?","
In the if construct:
    if isConnected {
        send_data();
    } else {
        show_error();
    }
show_error() will be executed because isConnected is false."
"In a conditional statement if user.isAdmin { grant_access() } else { deny_access() }, what happens when user.isAdmin is true?","
In this conditional statement:
    if user.isAdmin {
        grant_access();
    } else {
        deny_access();
    }
grant_access() gets executed because user.isAdmin evaluates to true."

"What is the outcome of the if statement in the code?
fn main() {
    let condition = true;
    let number = if condition {
        5

        6

    if number == 5 {

    }
}","It prints the string 'condition was true and number is 5' since the condition is true."
