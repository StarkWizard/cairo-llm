"How can you execute multiple lines of code in a match arm in Cairo?","To run multiple lines of code in a match arm in Cairo, you must use curly brackets, with a comma following the arm."
"If you want to bind to the value inside a Coin::Quarter variant, how would you do that in a match expression?","You can add a variable to the pattern that matches the Coin::Quarter variant. For example, Coin::Quarter(state) will bind the state variable to the value of that quarter’s state."
"How can you print the value of a variant of an enum in Cairo?","To print the value of a variant of an enum in Cairo, you need to add an implementation for the print function for the appropriate PrintTrait."
"How do you represent an enum variant that holds additional data in Cairo?","You can represent an enum variant that holds additional data by including the data type inside the variant. For example, Quarter: UsState in the Coin enum."
"Why must the order of match arms follow the same order as the enum in Cairo?","In Cairo, the order of the arms in a match expression must follow the same order as the enum to ensure exhaustive pattern matching and correct execution order."

"How do you extract values from enum variants in Cairo?","You can extract values from enum variants in Cairo using match arms that bind to the parts of the values matching the pattern."
"What's a potential consequence of not making matches exhaustive in Cairo?","If matches in Cairo are not exhaustive, it could lead to cases where certain values are not handled, leading to potential errors or unintended behavior."
"How do you implement a game logic in Cairo where you win if a number is 0 and lose for all other numbers?","You can use a match expression where the first arm checks if the number is 0 and prints 'You won!'. A catch-all pattern using _ can be used for all other numbers to print 'You lost...'."
"How does Cairo enforce exhaustive matching in match expressions?","If you don't cover every possible case in a match expression, Cairo won't compile the code, ensuring exhaustive matching is maintained."
"How does Cairo differentiate between various enum variants in a match expression?","Cairo differentiates between various enum variants in a match expression by comparing the given value against the patterns listed in the match arms, executing the code of the first matching pattern."
"What does the keyword Some in Cairo represent?","The keyword Some in Cairo represents a variant of the Option<T> enum that indicates the presence of a value."
"How can you create a generic function to handle Option values in Cairo?","You can define a function that accepts an argument of type Option<T>, where T is a generic type parameter, allowing it to handle various types wrapped in Option."
"How do you define an enum variant that holds additional data in Cairo?","In Cairo, an enum variant that holds additional data can be defined by including the data type inside the variant. For example, Coin::Quarter(UsState)."
"How does Cairo ensure that all possible values are handled in a match expression?","Cairo ensures that all possible values are handled in a match expression by enforcing exhaustive matching, which means the code won't compile if every possible value is not addressed in the match arms."
"What is the purpose of the None variant in the Option<T> enum in Cairo?","The None variant in the Option<T> enum in Cairo represents the absence of a value."
"How do you add functionality to an existing type in Cairo?","To add functionality to an existing type in Cairo, you can use implementations, as demonstrated by implementing the print function for the appropriate PrintTrait."
"How does Cairo ensure safety in its match expressions?","Cairo ensures safety in its match expressions by enforcing exhaustive matching and ensuring that all possible values are addressed."
"How do you specify a catch-all pattern in a match expression in Cairo?","In Cairo, you can specify a catch-all pattern in a match expression using the _ placeholder."

"In Cairo, considering a match arm like 'pattern => code', how are the code associated with a match arm and its pattern separated?","The code associated with a match arm is separated from its pattern by the => operator."

"Considering the value_in_cents function with a match expression that has arms like 'Coin::Penny => 1', how do you determine the value of a US coin using the match expression in Cairo?","You can use a match expression where each arm matches a variant of the Coin enum and returns its corresponding value in cents."
"In a Cairo match expression, how do you bind the state value from the 'Coin::Quarter(state)' variant?","In the match expression, you can use a pattern like Coin::Quarter(state) to bind the state variable to the value of the quarter’s state."
"In a Cairo function, given an enum like 'enum Coin { Penny, Nickel, Dime, Quarter(UsState) }', how can you represent an enum variant that holds additional data?","You can represent an enum variant that holds additional data by including the data type inside the variant. For example, Quarter: UsState in the Coin enum."
