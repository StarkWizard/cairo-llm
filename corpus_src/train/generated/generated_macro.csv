"
"how do macros in Cairo interact with the compiler?","Macros in Cairo provide instructions that are interpreted by the compiler to generate other code or compute values at compile time."
"What are the two main tasks combined by the array! macro in Cairo?","The two main tasks combined by the array! macro are declaring the array and appending each value to it."
"How do macros in Cairo contribute to code efficiency?","Macros in Cairo allow developers to write shorter and more simplified code by generating other code or computing values at compile time."

```"
"How does the array! macro differ from traditional array declaration and initialization in Cairo?","The array! macro combines the declaration and initialization steps into one, whereas traditionally you would declare the array and then append each value one by one."
"Can you infer if 'consteval_int!' is the only way to declare a constant in Cairo ?","No, see 'consteval_int!' as a way to declare a constant that is the result of a computation of integers at compile time, but it doesn't state if it's the only way to declare constants in Cairo."
