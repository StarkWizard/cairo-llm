"What can be defined in trait and impl blocks related to a type?","Methods"
"Are structs the only custom types available in Cairo?","No, there are also enums."
"How do you define the behavior of methods implemented for a type in Cairo?","Within the impl block associated with the trait."
"Is it a good practice to define methods for multiple types within the same impl block?","No, it can lead to confusion."
"How do parameters in methods work after the self parameter?","They work just like parameters in functions."

"What is the main advantage of using structs in Cairo?","To keep associated pieces of data connected and named for code clarity."
"What is the key difference between methods and regular functions in Cairo?","Methods are associated with a specific type and have a self parameter."
"Why would one choose the self: @Rectangle syntax for a method?","When they only want to read the data of the struct without taking ownership or writing to it."
"What is the main reason for the desnap operator * in the context?","Because the struct's field values are of type @T when passed as a snapshot and need to be desnapped for manipulation."
"Is it recommended to define methods for different types within the same impl block?","No, as it can lead to confusion."
"How do you ensure a method takes a mutable reference to self in Cairo?","Using the ref self: T syntax."
"What type of methods usually takes ownership of the instance using just self as the first parameter?","Methods that transform self into something else and prevent the caller from using the original instance after the transformation."
"Can non-method functions be defined within trait and impl blocks?","Yes"
"How are these non-method functions often used?","As constructors that return a new instance of the struct."
"What operator is used to call trait functions?","::"
"Is there any constraint on naming methods the same as one of the structâ€™s fields?","No, both a method and a field can have the same name."
"How does Cairo distinguish between a method and a field with the same name?","By checking for the use of parentheses after the name."
"How do methods enhance the organization of code in Cairo?","By grouping all functionalities related to a type in one combination of trait & impl blocks."
"Why might one implement multiple trait & impl blocks for the same type?","For a more granular code organization or to implement different traits."
"Can you implement the Add trait and Sub trait for a type in separate impl blocks?","Yes"
"How do you specify that a method takes an immutable snapshot of an instance in Cairo?","By using the @ snapshot operator in front of the type in the method's signature."
"In the given code `fn area(self: @Rectangle) -> u64;`, what keyword is used to define methods?","fn"
"Consider the code: `impl RectangleImpl of RectangleTrait { ... }`. Within which block do we define the behavior of the methods?","impl"
"Given the syntax: `fn area(self: @Rectangle) -> u64;`, what does the 'self: @Rectangle' part represent?","It represents the instance of the type the method is being called on."
"In the code: `(*self.width) * (*self.height)`, what is the purpose of the * operator?","It's the desnap operator used to access the values of a snapshot."
"How does the code `let rect1 = Rectangle { width: 30, height: 50, };` initialize `rect1`?","It initializes `rect1` as an instance of the `Rectangle` struct with a `width` of 30 and a `height` of 50."
"In the method: `fn can_hold(self: @Rectangle, other: @Rectangle) -> bool;`, what type of value does it return?","bool"
"Looking at the method `fn can_hold(self: @Rectangle, other: @Rectangle) -> bool;`, how many parameters does it take excluding 'self'?","1"
"In the function: `fn square(size: u64) -> Rectangle;`, what is the purpose of this function?","It returns a new `Rectangle` instance where both width and height are set to the given `size`, effectively creating a square."
"In the code: `let square = RectangleImpl::square(10);`, which syntax is used to call associated functions?","::"
"Considering the function: `fn area(self: @Rectangle) -> u64;`, what does the 'u64' indicate?","It indicates the return type of the function."
"In the trait declaration: `trait RectangleTrait { ... }`, how is a trait defined in Cairo?","Using the 'trait' keyword."
"Regarding the code: `Rectangle { width: size, height: size }`, what is being returned?","An instance of the `Rectangle` struct."
"When we encounter `RectangleImpl::square(10);`, what does the '::' operator denote?","It's used for calling trait functions or namespaces created by modules."
"Given the code: `struct Rectangle { width: u64, height: u64, }`, how is a struct defined in Cairo?","Using the 'struct' keyword."
"When looking at `impl RectangleCmpImpl of RectangleCmp { ... }`, what is the purpose of the 'impl' keyword?","It's used to define the implementation block for a trait."
"In the method: `fn can_hold(self: @Rectangle, other: @Rectangle) -> bool;`, what's the purpose of the 'other: @Rectangle' parameter?","It's to accept another `Rectangle` instance to check if it can fit inside the current instance."
"Given the code snippet: `*self.width > *other.width && *self.height > *other.height`, what is this method trying to determine?","It's determining whether the current rectangle's width and height are both greater than another rectangle's width and height, respectively."
"From the code: `RectangleImpl of RectangleTrait`, how do we associate an implementation with a trait?","By using the 'of' keyword."
