"Are both external and view functions public?","Yes, both external and view functions are public."
"How do you define an internal function in a contract?","To create an internal function in a contract, define it outside of the implementation block annotated with the #[external(v0)] attribute or inside blocks without the #[external(v0)] attribute."
"What does the #[generate_trait] attribute indicate in the context of a contract?","The #[generate_trait] attribute tells the compiler to generate a trait definition for the implementation block."

"Which function returns a name from the contract's state based on the code?","The function 'get_name' returns a name from the contract's state."
"What is a trait?","A trait is a common interface that types can implement, and in this context, it relates to the functions inside the contract."
"Can a contract have multiple constructors?","No, a contract can't have more than one constructor."
"Why might you use the #[generate_trait] attribute?","To automatically generate a trait definition for the associated implementation block, reducing boilerplate code."
"In which scenario is the 'ref' keyword used with 'self: ContractState'?","When the function needs to modify the state of the contract, the 'ref' keyword is used."
"Why might a contract need to use private or internal functions?","Private or internal functions allow encapsulation of logic and can only be called within the contract, ensuring controlled access to certain functionalities."
"How do you denote that a function is external and can modify the contract's state?","By passing 'self: ContractState' as a reference with the 'ref' keyword in the function parameters."
"In which function type, external or view, is the contract's state passed as a snapshot?","In view functions, the contract's state is passed as a snapshot."
"What attribute indicates that a function is public and can be accessed from outside of the contract?","The #[external(v0)] attribute gives a clue."
"How is the number of names stored in the contract incremented in the provided code?","By reading the current total using 'self.total_names.read()', then writing back the incremented value with 'self.total_names.write(total_names + 1)'."
"how do you distinguish between functions that can and cannot modify the contract's state?","By how the 'self: ContractState' parameter is passed. If it's passed by reference using 'ref', it can modify the state. If passed as a snapshot using '@', it cannot."
"What is an external function's relation to the contract's state?","External functions can modify the state of a contract when 'self: ContractState' is passed by reference."
"Which attribute is essential for functions that need to modify the contract's state?","The 'ref' keyword when passing 'self: ContractState'."
"how are functions that don't modify the contract's state but provide data denoted?","These are denoted as view functions, and 'self: ContractState' is passed as a snapshot using '@'."
"How do you make a function private or internal in a contract?","By defining it outside of a block annotated with the #[external(v0)] attribute or inside blocks without this attribute."
"How can you ensure that a function does not modify the contract's state?","By making it a view function and passing 'self: ContractState' as a snapshot using '@'."
"How do you annotate a function to indicate that it is a constructor for a contract?","By using the #[constructor] attribute."
"how do you define a function that is public and can be accessed externally?","By defining it inside an 'impl' block annotated with the #[external(v0)] attribute."
"What distinguishes view functions from external functions in terms of their interaction with the contract's state?","View functions access the contract's state in a read-only manner, ensuring it's not modified, while external functions can modify it."
"How is a constructor function differentiated from other functions in a contract?","A constructor function must be named 'constructor', can only be run once during contract deployment, and must be annotated with the #[constructor] attribute."
"what is the significance of the 'ref' keyword?","The 'ref' keyword is used to pass 'self: ContractState' by reference, allowing modification of the contract's state."
"what does the 'generate_trait' attribute do?","The 'generate_trait' attribute instructs the compiler to generate a trait definition for the associated implementation block."
"How are public functions that can modify the contract's state defined?","They are defined in an 'impl' block with the #[external(v0)] attribute, and 'self: ContractState' is passed by reference using the 'ref' keyword."
"how can you ensure that a public function doesn't modify the contract's state?","By making it a view function and passing 'self: ContractState' as a snapshot using '@'."
"How would you define a constructor in a contract that initializes the state with an owner?","To define a constructor, use the #[constructor] attribute and name the function 'constructor'. For initialization, you'd reference 'ref self: ContractState' as the first parameter and then write to its fields, such as 'self.names.write(owner.address, owner.name);'."
"How can you specify a function in a contract as publicly accessible from outside but doesn't modify the contract's state?","You'd define the function inside an implementation block annotated with the #[external(v0)] attribute. To ensure it doesn't modify the state, pass 'self: ContractState' as a snapshot using 'self: @ContractState'. This makes it a view function."
"Can you provide a code snippet that declares an external function which can modify the contract's state?","Sure! A function defined inside an implementation block annotated with the #[external(v0)] attribute and passing 'self: ContractState' as a reference using 'ref self: ContractState' would be an external function that can modify the contract's state."
"How do you automatically generate a trait definition for an implementation block in a contract?","Use the #[generate_trait] attribute above the implementation block to tell the compiler to generate a trait definition for it, reducing boilerplate code."
"How can you ensure a function is a constructor in a contract?","By annotating the function with the #[constructor] attribute and naming it 'constructor'. This function can only be run once during contract deployment and is used to initialize the state."
"In a contract, how do you define a function that can both be accessed externally and modify the contract's state?","You define the function inside an 'impl' block annotated with the #[external(v0)] attribute. If the function needs to modify the state, you pass 'self: ContractState' as a reference using the 'ref' keyword."
"How would you denote a function in a contract that only provides data and ensures the contract's state is not modified?","You would define it as a view function. To ensure it's read-only, you'd pass 'self: ContractState' as a snapshot using the '@' symbol."
