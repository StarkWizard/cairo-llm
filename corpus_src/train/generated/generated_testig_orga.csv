question,answer
"What are the two main categories of tests?","Unit tests and integration tests."
"What distinguishes unit tests from other tests?","Unit tests are small, focused, test one module in isolation at a time, and can test private functions."
"Which language or framework doesn't implement the concept of public/private functions/fields yet?","Cairo."
"How do integration tests utilize your code?","Integration tests use your code in the same way any other external code would, using only the public interface and potentially exercising multiple modules per test."
"Why is writing both unit and integration tests important?","To ensure that the pieces of your library are doing what you expect them to, separately and together."
"Where should you place unit tests in relation to the code they test?","In the src directory in each file with the code that they’re testing."
"How is the tests module conventionally named in each file?","It is conventionally named as 'tests'."
"What does the #[cfg(test)] annotation do?","It tells Cairo to compile and run the test code only when you run 'scarb cairo-test', not when you run 'cairo-run'."
"Why don't integration tests need the #[cfg(test)] annotation?","Because integration tests go in a different directory, they don’t need the #[cfg(test)] annotation."
"What configuration does the attribute 'cfg' stand for?","The 'cfg' attribute stands for 'configuration'."
"When does Cairo compile the test code based on the cfg attribute?","Cairo compiles the test code only if we actively run the tests with 'scarb cairo-test'."
"What is the purpose of integration tests?","To test whether many parts of your library work together correctly."
"What directory should you create for integration tests?","You should create a 'tests' directory."
"How can you bring tested functions into each test file scope?","By adding
```
    use <library_name>::<function_name>
```
at the top of the code."
"How can you run only integration tests based?","By using the command
```
    scarb test -f integration_tests
```
"
"What is the expected output of running tests as mentioned?","One line output for each test indicating its result."
"How is an assertion made?","Using the 'assert' function, like
```
    assert(result == 4, result is not 4');
```
"

```
    scarb cairo-test
```"

"what is the purpose of 'assert(it_adds_two(2, 2) == 4, 'internal_adder failed');'?","To check that the function 'it_adds_two' when passed the arguments 2 and 2 returns a result of 4, and to fail the test with the message 'internal_adder failed' if it doesn't."
"What does the #[test] annotation above a function signify?","It signifies that the function is a test function."
"Where do you typically place unit tests in the Cairo structure?","In the 'src' directory in each file with the code that they're testing."
"How do you exclude test functions from the compiled result in the same file as the code?","By using the #[cfg(test)] annotation."
"why might unit tests and integration tests behave differently even if the individual units work correctly on their own?","Units of code that work correctly on their own could have problems when integrated."
"How is the test module typically annotated to tell Cairo it's a test module?","By using the #[cfg(test)] annotation."
"In the directory structure, where is the file for integration tests located?","The file for integration tests is located in 'src/tests/integration_test.cairo'."
"How do you typically run all integration tests?","By adding a filter to only run tests whose path contains 'integration_tests' using the command 'scarb test -f integration_tests'."
"How does Cairo know which code is a test code and which is not?","Using the #[test] annotation for test functions and #[cfg(test)] for test modules."
"What is the result of the command 'scarb test -f integration_tests'?","The tests are run, and an output line is shown for each test indicating its result."
"Which command is used to run the tests in Cairo?","scarb cairo-test."
"What does the cfg(test) attribute do when placed above a module?","It tells Cairo to compile and run the test code only when tests are being run and not when the library is being built normally."
"What command results in compilation and execution of the test code?","scarb cairo-test."
"In the directory structure, what is the parent directory of 'lib.cairo'?","The parent directory of 'lib.cairo' is 'src'."
"How do you test the integrated parts of your library?","By creating integration tests in a 'tests' directory."
"How is a test module typically named in each file?","It is typically named 'tests'."
"Where do you place the unit tests in the Cairo structure?","In the 'src' directory in each file with the code that they’re testing."
"Which directory structure represents the location of integration tests in the provided example?","adder > src > tests > integration_test.cairo."
"How do you run tests that only match a specific filter?","By using the command 'scarb test -f <filter_name>'."
"What is the purpose of the 'available_gas' annotation in the provided code?","To specify the gas limit for the test."
"In the code 'assert(it_adds_two(2, 2) == 4, 'internal_adder failed');', what is being asserted?","It's being asserted that the function 'it_adds_two' returns a value of 4 when passed the arguments 2 and 2."
"how do you run tests with a specific configuration option?","Using the 'scarb cairo-test' command along with the cfg attribute in the code."
"How do you bring a function into the scope of a test file in Cairo?","By using the 'use' statement followed by the library and function name."
"Where should the tests for integration be placed in the provided directory structure?","They should be placed in a 'tests' directory inside the 'src' directory."
"How do you typically name a module that contains test functions?","It is typically named 'tests'."
"Given the assertion 'assert(result == 4, 'result is not 4');', how is an assertion being made in the code?","Using the 'assert' function to check if 'result' is equal to 4, and providing a failure message 'result is not 4'."
"In the code segment 'mod tests;', what does the 'mod' keyword denote?","It denotes a module."
"What does the annotation '#[test]' above a function indicate in the code?","It signifies that the function is a test function."
"In the function 'fn it_adds_two(a: u8, b: u8) -> u8 { a + b }', what is its purpose based on its code?","To add two numbers (a and b) and return the result."
"Given the code '#[cfg(test)]', how do you exclude functions from the compiled result when they're in the same file as the main code?","By using the #[cfg(test)] annotation to specify that the following code should only be compiled and run during testing."
"How do you run all integration tests given the command 'scarb test -f integration_tests'?","By adding a filter to only run tests whose path contains 'integration_tests' using that command."
"How does Cairo differentiate between test code and non-test code based on the annotation '#[test]'?","The #[test] annotation indicates that the subsequent function is a test function."

"What is the configuration option checked by the 'cfg' attribute in the code snippet '#[cfg(test)] mod tests;'?","The configuration option 'test'."
"Based on the code '#[available_gas(2000000)]', what is the purpose of the 'available_gas' annotation?","To specify the gas limit for the test."
"In the code 'assert(it_adds_two(2, 2) == 4, 'internal_adder failed');', what condition is being checked by the assert function?","It's checking if the function 'it_adds_two' returns a value of 4 when passed the arguments 2 and 2."
"Given the directory structure, in which directory are unit tests typically placed?","Unit tests are placed in the 'src' directory in each file with the code that they're testing."
