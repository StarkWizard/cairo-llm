"What is an array'?","An array is a collection of elements of the same type."
"When you want to create and use array methods and you come across 'importing the array::ArrayTrait trait', what is this action allowing you to do?","You can create and use array methods by importing the array::ArrayTrait trait."
" do arrasys offer a wide variety of ways to be altered?","No, arrays have limited modifications options."
"If you are told that 'arrays are queues whose values can't be modified', what does this mean about changing values in an array?","The values of arrays can't be modified."
"If memory slots in an array system can't be overwritten once written to, but only read, can you change previously set values?","No, once a memory slot is written to, it cannot be overwritten, but only read from it."
"what are your modification limits to an array?","You can only append items to the end of an array and remove items from the front."
"In a programming environment where you create an array using 'ArrayTrait::new()', how do you instantiate an array?","An array is created with the ArrayTrait::new() call."
"how can you specify the expected type of items in an array during its creation?","You can pass the expected type of items inside the array when instantiating or explicitly define the type the variable."
"When you see the command 'a.append(2);', what action is being taken on an array?","To add an element to the end of an array, you can use the append() method."
"=how do you take items out from the array?","You can use the pop_front() method."
"what is the outcome if you try to remove an item from an empty array?","It returns Option::None."
"Given the code snippet: 'let mut a = ArrayTrait::new(); a.append(10); a.append(1); a.append(2); let first_value = a.pop_front().unwrap(); first_value.print();', what number will be printed and why?","It will print '10'. Because 10 was the first element added to the array, and it gets removed using pop_front()."
"If 'memory in Cairo is immutable', what does this mean about changing data once it's set in memory?","In Cairo, memory cannot be changed once set."
"can you change array elements after their addition in Cairo?","No, it's not possible to modify the elements of an array once they've been added in Cairo."
"how are elements added or removed without directly altering the memory?","These operations involve updating pointers rather than directly modifying the memory cells."
"what type of operation is needed when adding to the end or removing from the front?","These operations do not require memory mutation."
"If 'memory in Cairo is immutable', making it impossible to modify existing memory slots, how can you only append to the end and pop from the front of arrays?","Because memory in Cairo is immutable, making it impossible to modify existing memory slots."
"during array creation in Cairo, how are you defining the type of a variable?","You can use syntax like
```
    let mut arr:Array<u128> = ArrayTrait::new();
```
