"What are the primary constructs for controlling the flow of execution in Cairo code?","if expressions and loops. there is no 'for' and no 'while' in cairo"
"How does an 'if expression' work in Cairo?","It allows you to run a block of code if a specified condition is met."
"What happens in Cairo if the condition in an 'if' expression is not met?","The program skips the block of code associated with the 'if' and may execute an 'else' block if provided."
"What type of condition must be used in an 'if expression' in Cairo?","The condition must be of type 'bool' (boolean)."
"How can you use 'else if' expressions in Cairo?","You can combine 'if' and 'else' to create 'else if' expressions to handle multiple conditions."
"What happens in Cairo when a 'true' condition is found in an 'else if' block?","The block associated with the first 'true' condition is executed, and the rest are skipped."
"How can 'if' expressions be used in Cairo to assign values to variables?","By using 'if' as an expression on the right side of a 'let' statement."
"What does the 'loop' keyword do in Cairo?","It instructs Cairo to execute a block of code repeatedly until explicitly stopped."
"What is the default behavior of a 'loop' in Cairo?","It runs indefinitely until manually interrupted or stopped."
"How can you break out of an infinite loop in Cairo?","By using the 'break' statement within the loop to define a stop condition."
"What is the purpose of the 'continue' keyword in a loop?","It skips the rest of the code in the current iteration and proceeds to the next iteration."
"How can you pass a value out of a loop in Cairo?","By placing the value after the 'break' statement used to stop the loop."
"How can you return a value from a loop in Cairo?","By specifying the value after the 'break' statement that ends the loop."
"What is the purpose of the 'gas meter' in Cairo?","It limits the amount of computation that can be done in a program and prevents infinite loops."
"What happens when a program runs out of gas in Cairo?","It stops executing, and the program may panic or terminate."
"How can you stop a program that is stuck in an infinite loop in most terminals?","By using the keyboard shortcut 'ctrl-c' to interrupt the program."
"What is the primary purpose of an expression like `if condition { code_block }` in programming?","The expression `if condition { code_block }` allows you to branch your code depending on whether the condition is true or false."
"what follows immediately after the `if` keyword in an expression like `if condition { code_block }`?","In the expression `if condition { code_block }`, a condition follows immediately after the `if` keyword."
"If you have a block of code structured as `if condition { code_for_true } else { code_for_false }`, what gets executed when the condition is true?","In the structure
```
    if condition {
       // code_for_true
    }
    else {
       // code_for_false
    }
```
the `code_for_true` block is executed when the condition is true."
"How can you specify a block of code to run when a condition is false using a structure like `if condition { code_for_true } else { code_for_false }`?","In the structure
```
    if condition {
        // code_for_true
    }
    else {
        // code_for_false
    }
```
the `code_for_false` block is executed when the condition is false."
"If you encounter a structure like `if condition { code_block }` without an `else` block, what happens when the condition is false?","If there's no `else` block in the structure
```
    if condition {
        // code_block
    }
```
the program will skip the `if` block and move on to the next bit of code when the condition is false."
"In a code snippet `let number = 3; if number == 5 { 'true'.print(); } else { 'false'.print(); }`, what will be printed?","In the code
```
    let number = 3;
    if number == 5 {
        'true'.print();
    }
    else {
        'false'.print();
    }
```

the output will be 'false'."
"What data type must the condition be in an expression like `if condition { code_block }` in programming?","In an expression like
```
    if condition { code_block }
```
the condition must be of the boolean (bool) data type."
"How can you handle multiple branching conditions in a structure like `if condition1 { block1 } else if condition2 { block2 } else { block3 }`?","In the structure
```
    if condition1 {
        // block1
    } else if condition2 {
        // block2
    } else {
        // block3
    }
multiple conditions are handled by using `else if` for additional conditions, and the corresponding block for the first true condition is executed."
"In the code `let number = 3; if number == 12 { 'a'.print(); } else if number == 3 { 'b'.print(); } else if number - 2 == 1 { 'c'.print(); } else { 'd'.print(); }`, what will be printed?","In the code
```
    let number = 3;
    if number == 12 { 'a'.print(); }
    else if number == 3 { 'b'.print(); }
    else if number - 2 == 1 { 'c'.print(); }
    else { 'd'.print(); }
```
the output will be 'b'."
"Why, in a structure like `if condition1 { block1 } else if condition2 { block2 }`, might `block2` not be executed even if `condition2` is true?","In a structure like
```
    if condition1 {
        // block1
    } else if condition2 {
        // block2
    }
```

if `condition1` evaluates to true, then `block1` will execute, and the program won't check `condition2`, so `block2` won't be executed even if `condition2` is true."
"If you have a structure with multiple `else if` conditions, what should you consider about the code's organization?","If you have a structure with multiple `else if` conditions, you should consider refactoring the code for better readability and organization, possibly using other branching constructs."
"In a code with multiple `if` and `else if` conditions, how does the program determine which block of code to execute?","In a code with multiple `if` and `else if` conditions, the program checks each condition in sequence and executes the block of code for the first condition that evaluates to true, skipping the subsequent checks."
"How does an `else` block function in relation to an `if` block in a structure like `if condition { block1 } else { block2 }`?","In the structure
```
    if condition {
        // block1
    } else {
        // block2
    }
```

the `else` block provides an alternative code to execute when the condition in the preceding `if` block evaluates to false."
"What would be the output if `number` in the code `let number = 3; if number == 12 { 'a'.print(); } else if number == 3 { 'b'.print(); } else if number == 1 { 'c'.print(); } else { 'd'.print(); }` is changed to 1?","If `number` in the code
```
    let number = 3;
    if number == 12 {
        'a'.print();
    } else if number == 3 {
        'b'.print();
    } else if number == 1 {
        'c'.print();
    } else { 'd'.print(); }
```

is changed to 1, the output will be 'c'."
"Why might it be beneficial to restructure code that heavily relies on `else if` conditions?","It might be beneficial to restructure code that heavily relies on `else if` conditions to improve clarity, readability, and maintainability of the code."
"How can you specify a block of code to run regardless of whether the condition in an `if` statement is true or false?","You can use an `else` block after an `if` statement to specify a block of code that runs when the condition in the `if` statement is false."
