"Can you call functions that might panic from within a function annotated with nopanic?","No, only nopanic functions can be called from within a nopanic function."
"How can you indicate a function in Cairo that should panic if it returns None or Err?","By using the 'panic_with' attribute, which takes two arguments: the data passed as the panic reason and the name for a wrapping function."
"What is the primary purpose of the assert function from the Cairo core library?","The assert function verifies that a given boolean expression is true at runtime, and if it isn't, it calls the panic function with a specified error value."
