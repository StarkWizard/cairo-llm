"what does a storage slot refer to?","In Cairo smart contracts, a storage slot refers to a space in the contract's storage where data can be stored, and each storage slot costs gas to write to."

"What type of values does the StorePacking trait deal with?","The StorePacking trait deals with struct fields and aims to pack them into fewer storage slots by converting them into a specific packed storage type like 'u128'."
"How can developers extend the bit-packing technique for their specific needs?","Developers can define their own structs and implement custom logic to pack and unpack them based on their specific bit size and storage requirements."
"Why is it mentioned to use felt252 or u256 for the StorePacking::pack output most of the time?","Most of the time, it's preferable to pack into a 'felt252' or 'u256' because they are common storage types. If developers want to pack into their custom type, they must ensure that their type implements the Store trait."
"Which arithmetic operations are commonly used during the unpacking process?","During the unpacking process, right shift (division) and bitwise AND operations are commonly used to extract the original fields from a packed value."
"Is it always necessary to use a bitmask when unpacking fields?","No, it's not always necessary. For instance, when unpacking the last field (like 'medium'), no bitmask is required as the higher bits are already 0."
"Which trait implementation informs the compiler about how to handle types that use the StorePacking trait?","The StoreUsingPacking implementation of the Store trait informs the compiler how to handle types that use the StorePacking trait."
"What does it mean when a type implements the Store trait in the context of Cairo smart contracts?","If a type implements the Store trait in Cairo smart contracts, it means that the type can be written to and read from the contract's storage."
