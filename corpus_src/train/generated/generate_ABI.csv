"Why must the trait for a contract interface be generic over the TContractState type?","This is required for functions to access the contract's storage, enabling them to read and write to it."
"What doesn't the interface of a contract include?","The contract constructor and internal functions are not part of the interface."
"how is a view function differentiated from an external function in terms of parameters?","View functions have a self parameter of type @TContractState, while external functions have a self parameter of type passed by reference ref self: TContractState."
"What does the 'name' function in the IERC20 interface return?","The 'name' function returns a value of type 'felt252'."
"What does the 'approve' function in the IERC20 interface do?","It allows for setting or changing the allowance a spender has on an owner's tokens and returns a boolean indicating success."
"Describe the parameters and return type of the 'transfer' function in the ERC20 interface.","The 'transfer' function takes in parameters: a reference to the contract state (ref self: TContractState), recipient's ContractAddress, and an amount of type u256. It returns a boolean indicating success."
"what is the purpose of 'transfer_from' function in the IERC20 interface?","The 'transfer_from' function allows for transferring tokens from one account to another, with parameters for the sender, recipient, and amount, returning a boolean for success."
"Give a brief definition of cross-contract interactions in the context of smart contracts.","Cross-contract interactions enable smart contracts on a blockchain to communicate and interact with each other."
"Why are interactions between smart contracts significant when designing decentralized applications?","They allow for composability and separation of concerns, facilitating the creation of complex decentralized applications."
"What do we mean by 'composability' in decentralized applications?","Composability refers to the ability to combine different smart contracts or components seamlessly to achieve more complex operations or functionalities."
"Define 'separation of concerns' in the context of smart contract development.","Separation of concerns means dividing a program into distinct sections, each handling a specific task or functionality, improving modularity and readability."
"How are smart contract logics typically written for Starknet?","Smart contract logics for Starknet are typically written in high-level Cairo."
"After writing the smart contract in Cairo, how is it stored on the VM?","It is stored on the VM as executable bytecodes in binary formats."
"What role do ABIs play in interpreting bytecode?","ABIs define specific methods which can be called to a smart contract for execution, helping external actors understand how to interact with the bytecode."
"What is a block explorer in the context of smart contracts?","A block explorer is a tool that provides information about blocks, transactions, and other activities on a blockchain."
"Which Starknet tool can you use to inspect blocks and transactions?","You can use block explorers like Voyager or Starkscan."
"How does the interface define the visibility of a function?","The interface specifies the function's visibility through its function signature."
"What is a trait in the context of Cairo programming?","A trait in Cairo defines shared behavior, similar to interfaces in other languages. It's a way to define methods that can be used across multiple structs or data types."
"What is the significance of the '@' symbol in the parameter type '@TContractState'?","In the given context, the '@' symbol denotes a specific way of passing the parameter in Cairo, distinguishing view functions from external functions."
"What are dispatchers and syscalls in the context of Starknet contracts?","Dispatchers and syscalls are mechanisms to facilitate cross-contract interactions and system-level operations in Starknet."
"How does the 'decimals' function in the IERC20 interface represent the token precision?","The 'decimals' function returns a value of type 'u8', indicating the number of decimal places the token uses."
"What is the difference between the 'transfer' and 'transfer_from' functions in terms of parameters?","The 'transfer' function takes a recipient and amount, while 'transfer_from' also requires a sender parameter."
"What is the main purpose of the 'allowance' function in the IERC20 interface?","The 'allowance' function checks the number of tokens an owner has allowed a spender to use and returns that amount."
"Why is there a need for cross-contract interactions in decentralized applications?","To allow composability and separation of concerns, enabling the development of complex decentralized applications."
"What does the acronym 'dApps' stand for?","dApps stands for decentralized applications."
"How are Starknet contracts stored after being written in high-level Cairo?","They are stored on the VM as executable bytecodes in binary formats."
"How does the ABI assist dApps frontends in interacting with smart contracts?","The ABI allows dApps frontends to format data correctly, making it comprehensible for the smart contract and vice versa."
"How do you specify public functions in a Starknet contract?","You specify them in the contract's interface."
"Why is a contract's storage important for its functions?","The contract's storage allows functions to read from and write data to it."
"Can you execute internal functions of a contract through its interface?","No, internal functions are not part of the interface."
"Why do view functions in the IERC20 interface have a '@TContractState' type parameter?","It's required for these functions to access the contract's storage to read data."
"How do external functions in the IERC20 interface differ from view functions in terms of accessing the contract's storage?","External functions have a self parameter passed by reference, allowing them to both read and modify the contract's storage."
"What would a developer use to interact with a Starknet contract through a block explorer?","They would use the contract's ABI to format the data for interaction."
"what kind of information can the 'name' function in the IERC20 interface provide?","The 'name' function provides the name of the token represented by the contract."
"In the context of smart contracts, what is the significance of 'composability'?","Composability allows different smart contracts to be combined or used together, enabling the creation of complex functionalities or operations."
"What purpose does the 'symbol' function serve in the IERC20 interface?","The 'symbol' function provides the symbol or abbreviation of the token represented by the contract."
"Given the IERC20 interface, how do you know the precision or decimal places of the token?","By calling the 'decimals' function, which returns a value of type 'u8' indicating the number of decimal places."
"How can one determine the total amount of tokens in circulation using the IERC20 interface?","By calling the 'total_supply' function."
