"give a simple implementation of the SimpleStorage contract ?","it's a sample contract :#[starknet::interface]
trait ISimpleStorage<TContractState> {
    fn set(ref self: TContractState, x: u128);
    fn get(self: @TContractState) -> u128;
}

#[starknet::contract]
mod SimpleStorage {

    #[storage]
    struct Storage {
        stored_data: u128
    }

    #[external(v0)]
    impl SimpleStorage of super::ISimpleStorage<ContractState> {
        fn set(ref self: ContractState, x: u128) {
            self.stored_data.write(x);
        }
        fn get(self: @ContractState) -> u128 {
            self.stored_data.read()
        }
    }
}"
"What does the 'starknet::interface' attribute indicate?","The 'starknet::interface' attribute indicates that the following trait defines the interface of a Starknet contract."
"What is the role of the 'Storage' struct in a contract?","The 'Storage' struct declares the storage variable(s) for the contract."
"What is the difference between a contract's interface and its implementation in Starknet?","The interface defines the functions the contract exposes, while the implementation provides the actual behavior of those functions."
"How do you ensure that the implementation of a contract matches its interface in Starknet?","By leveraging the traits & impls mechanism from Cairo and making sure that the implementation conforms to the declared interface. Non-conformance results in a compilation error."
"What happens if you try to modify storage inside the 'get' function?
    #[external(v0)]
    impl SimpleStorage of super::ISimpleStorage<ContractState> {
        fn set(ref self: ContractState, x: u128) {
            self.stored_data.write(x);
        }
        fn get(self: @ContractState) -> u128 {
            self.stored_data.read()
        }
    }
","The compiler will complain because the 'get' function does not modify the state, as indicated by how 'TContractState' is passed to it."
"What are public functions?","Public functions are functions that are exposed to the outside world. They can be called by anyone and can be invoked both from outside and within the contract."
"What differentiates an external function from a view function in Starknet?","An external function can mutate the state of the contract when invoked through a transaction, whereas a view function cannot mutate the contract's state."
"Why is the 'external(v0)' attribute important in the contract's implementation?","The 'external(v0)' attribute exposes the functions defined in the implementation to the outside world. Without it, the functions won't be callable from the outside."
"What does the 'ContractState' type represent?","'ContractState' is generated by the compiler and gives access to the storage variables defined in the 'Storage' struct. It represents the contract's state."
"How do you modify the value of a storage variable in Starknet contract functions?","You use the 'self' prefix followed by the '.write' method. For example: 'self.stored_data.write(x);'."
"What happens if you try to modify the contract state when it's passed as a snapshot?","Attempting to modify will result in a compilation error."
"What is the significance of the 'ref' keyword in the 'set' function definition?","The 'ref' keyword implies that the function may modify the contract state or the storage variables inside it."
"Why is the 'ContractState' type used as a parameter in the functions of the contract's implementation?","'ContractState' provides access to the storage variables of the contract and represents the current state of the contract."
"How do you annotate the functions that are callable from outside in a Starknet contract?","You use the 'external(v0)' attribute before the implementation block. This exposes all functions defined in that block as public functions."
"What does the 'get_caller_address' function from 'starknet' likely do?","The 'get_caller_address' function likely returns the address of the entity that called a particular function or initiated a transaction."
"What is the significance of 'ContractAddress'","'ContractAddress' is likely a type or struct from the 'starknet' module, potentially representing the address of a contract on the Starknet blockchain."
"How can you describe the purpose of the 'set' function based on its signature?
 #[external(v0)]
    impl SimpleStorage of super::ISimpleStorage<ContractState> {
    fn set(ref self: ContractState, x: u128)
    {
        // CODE here
    }    
    }
","The 'set' function takes the current contract state and a number of type 'u128' as parameters. It's likely used to set or store this number in the contract's state."
"What is implied when the 'get' function takes a snapshot of 'TContractState'?","It implies that the 'get' function does not modify the contract's state."
"What are the key components of a Starknet contract?","A Starknet contract consists of an interface (defined using traits), storage structures, and an implementation block that provides the behavior of the contract functions."
"How do you represent a single slot in a database within a Starknet contract?","You can represent it using a struct like 'Storage' and declaring a variable inside it, such as 'stored_data' of type 'u128'."
"What does the 'starknet::get_caller_address' function likely provide?","The function 'starknet::get_caller_address' likely provides the address of the caller or initiator of a contract function or transaction."
"Why would you use the 'trait' keyword in defining a Starknet contract?","The 'trait' keyword is used to define the interface of the contract, which represents the functions the contract exposes to the outside world."
"What is implied by the 'starknet::view' attribute in the 'get' function?
    #[external(v0)]
    impl SimpleStorage of super::ISimpleStorage<ContractState> {
        fn set(ref self: ContractState, x: u128) {
            self.stored_data.write(x);
        }
        fn get(self: @ContractState) -> u128 {
            self.stored_data.read()
        }
    }
","The 'starknet::view' attribute implies that the 'get' function will not modify the contract's state."
"How are storage variables defined in Starknet contracts?","Storage variables are defined inside structs, such as the 'Storage' struct, with their respective types."
"Can a Starknet contract have more than one storage variable?","Yes, a Starknet contract can have more than one storage variable. They would be defined as separate fields within the struct representing the contract's storage."
"How is the behavior of a Starknet contract function defined?","The behavior of a Starknet contract function is defined in the contract's implementation block, where the actual code for the function is provided."
"How can you describe the relationship between 'ISimpleStorage' and 'SimpleStorage'?","'ISimpleStorage' defines the interface of the contract, specifying the functions that the contract exposes. 'SimpleStorage' provides the actual implementation for these functions, defining their behavior."
"What does the 'impl' keyword indicate?","The 'impl' keyword indicates the beginning of the implementation block for the functions defined in the contract's interface."
"How are functions exposed to the outside world in Starknet contracts?","Functions are exposed to the outside world in Starknet contracts using the 'external(v0)' attribute before the implementation block."
"What is the significance of the 'starknet' module?","The 'starknet' module likely provides utility functions, types, and attributes specific to Starknet contracts, such as 'get_caller_address' and 'starknet::view'."
"How do you identify which functions of a Starknet contract can modify its state?","Functions that can modify the contract's state have the contract state passed to them using the 'ref' keyword, like 'ref self: ContractState'."
"What happens when the 'set' function of the 'SimpleStorage' contract is called?","When the 'set' function is called, it takes a number as a parameter and stores it in the 'stored_data' variable of the contract."
"How do you change the state of a Starknet contract?","The state of a Starknet contract can be changed by calling functions that take the contract state as a 'ref' parameter and modify its storage variables, such as the 'set' function in the provided 'SimpleStorage' contract."
"What does the attribute 'starknet::interface' in the contract indicate?","The 'starknet::interface' attribute indicates that the following trait defines the interface of a Starknet contract."
"What is the difference between a contract's interface, like 'ISimpleStorage', and its implementation in Starknet?","The interface defines the functions the contract exposes, while the implementation provides the actual behavior of those functions."
"How do you ensure that the implementation of a contract matches its interface in Starknet?","By leveraging the traits & impls mechanism from Cairo and making sure that the implementation conforms to the declared interface. Non-conformance results in a compilation error."
"What does the 'ContractState' type represent?","'ContractState' is generated by the compiler and gives access to the storage variables defined in the 'Storage' struct. It represents the contract's state."
"What happens if you try to modify the contract state when it's passed as a snapshot?","Attempting to modify will result in a compilation error."
"What can you infer about the 'starknet::interface' and 'starknet::contract' attributes?","The 'starknet::interface' attribute is used to indicate that a trait defines the interface of a Starknet contract, while the 'starknet::contract' attribute marks a module as defining a Starknet contract."
"How do you identify which functions of a contract, can modify its state?","Functions that can modify the contract's state have the contract state passed to them using the 'ref' keyword, like 'ref self: ContractState'."
"How do you change the state of a Starknet contract?","The state of a Starknet contract can be changed by calling functions that take the contract state as a 'ref' parameter and modify its storage variables, such as the 'set' function in the provided 'SimpleStorage' contract."
