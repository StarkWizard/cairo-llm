"How do modules help in controlling scope in programming?","Modules help in organizing code within a crate for readability and easy reuse."

"How do you declare a new module in a crate root file?","You declare a new module in the crate root file with the syntax 'mod module_name;'."
"Where does the compiler look for code to compile first when compiling a crate?","The compiler first looks in the crate root file (e.g., src/lib.cairo) for code to compile."
"How can you declare a submodule in a file other than the crate root?","You can declare a submodule with the syntax 'mod submodule_name;' in any file other than the crate root."
"What is the purpose of paths in the context of modules?","Paths allow you to refer to code in a module from anywhere else in the same crate, using the path to the code."
