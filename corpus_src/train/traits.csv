Why does this progam makes an error ?

use debug::PrintTrait;

struct Rectangle {
    width: u64,
    height: u64,
}

fn main() {
    let rectangle = Rectangle { width: 30, height: 10, };
    rectangle.print();
}","

You need to implement the PrintTrait for Rectangle.
Here is an example of how to do it:
```
use debug::PrintTrait;

struct Rectangle {
    width: u64,
    height: u64,
}

fn main() {
    let rectangle = Rectangle { width: 30, height: 10, };
    rectangle.print();
}

impl RectanglePrintImpl of PrintTrait<Rectangle> {
    fn print(self: Rectangle) {
        self.width.print();
        self.height.print();
    }
}
```

"Why does this program produce an error when trying to print a tuple in cairo?

use debug::PrintTrait;

fn main() {
    let point = (10, 20);
    point.print();
}
","
You can't directly print a tuple. You need to implement PrintTrait or print each element separately.
Here is how you can print each element:
use debug::PrintTrait;

fn main() {
    let point = (10, 20);
    point.0.print();  // prints the first element of the tuple
    point.1.print();  // prints the second element of the tuple
}

"What's the problem with printing a custom struct directly in cairo?
use debug::PrintTrait;

struct Point {
    x: i64,
    y: i64,
}

fn main() {
    let my_point = Point { x: 10, y: 20 };
    my_point.print();
}
","
The PrintTrait is not implemented for the Point struct. You need to manually implement it.
Here is an example:
use debug::PrintTrait;

struct Point {
    x: i64,
    y: i64,
}

impl PointPrintImpl of PrintTrait<Point> {
    fn print(self: Point) {
        self.x.print();
        self.y.print();
    }
}

fn main() {
    let my_point = Point { x: 10, y: 20 };
    my_point.print();
}

"Why won't this code compile when attempting to print a custom enum variant in cairo?
use debug::PrintTrait;

enum Direction {
    North,
    South,
    East,
    West,
}

fn main() {
    let my_direction = Direction::North;
    my_direction.print();
}
","
Enums in Cairo can't be printed without implementing the PrintTrait for each variant.
Here is a corrected version:

use debug::PrintTrait;

enum Direction {
    North,
    South,
    East,
    West,
}

impl DirectionPrintImpl of PrintTrait<Direction> {
    fn print(self: Direction) {
        match self {
            Direction::North => 'North'.print(),
            Direction::South => 'South'.print(),
            Direction::East => 'East'.print(),
            Direction::West => 'West'.print(),
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let my_direction = Direction::North;
    my_direction.print();
}
