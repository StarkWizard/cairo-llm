"how can I cast a variable to another type","n Cairo, you can convert types scalar types from one type to another by using the 'try_into' and 'into' methods provided by the 'TryInto' and 'Into' traits, respectively."
"What does the 'try_into' method do ?","The try_into method allows for safe type casting when the target type might not fit the source value. Keep in mind that try_into returns an Option<T> type, which you'll need to unwrap to access the new value"
"what does the 'into' method do ?"," the into method can be used for type casting when success is guaranteed, such as when the source type is smaller than the destination type."
"how does into and try_into work ?","To perform the conversion, call var.into() or var.try_into() on the source value to cast it to another type. The new variable's type must be explicitly defined"
