# Expanding the Training Corpus for a Language Model

Language models have revolutionized the field of natural language processing. The efficacy of these models depends heavily on the quality and variety of the training data they are exposed to. In this comprehensive guide, we'll walk you through the steps and considerations for contributing to the training corpus of a model to ensure its continued growth and improvement.

## Understanding the Corpus Structure

The corpus is the lifeblood of a language model. It's a collection of texts that the model uses to learn how language is structured and applied in various contexts. When contributing to the corpus of a language model, understanding the structure of the existing data is crucial.

### The `corpus_src` Directory

Training files reside within the `corpus_src` directory. This directory contains CSV files, each designed to encapsulate specific aspects of language or topics. For example, if you're adding content about programming loops, you'd navigate to the `loop.csv` file.

### File Naming Conventions

File names should be descriptive of their content. For instance, if adding content about a new library, the file name should include the library's name. This makes it easy to identify the training set's purpose and content.

### Source Documentation

When using any external source like documentation, a website, or an article from Medium, it's good practice to mention this in the `sources.txt` file located at the project's root. This helps maintain a record of the materials that influenced the training data.

### Problem Reporting

If an issue arises in the generated content—for instance, a generated contract contains an erroneous `for` loop—it should be documented. Add an example of the incorrect generation to the `to_correct.txt` file, also at the root of the project.

## Crafting the CSV Files

A CSV (Comma-Separated Values) file is a simple format used to store tabular data. It's supported by most data processing tools and is particularly suited for handling large volumes of text.

### Selecting an Editor

On Linux systems, Okular is an excellent choice for editing CSV files. Regardless of your operating system, ensure the editor you choose can handle multiline text entries easily.

### CSV Structure

The CSV file should start with the headers `question,answer` to define the two fields. Below is how you would structure the entries:

```csv
question,answer
"question 1","answer 1"
"question 2","answer 2"
"question 3","long answer that can
span multiple lines"
```
### Syntax Precision
Accuracy in syntax is paramount:

Ensure there are no spaces between the commas and quotation marks.
Use single quotes within your content if you need to quote text, as double quotes are used to encapsulate CSV fields.
Here's an example of the correct and incorrect syntax:

Correct:
```csv
"print 'hello world'","'hello world'.print()"
```
Incorrect:

```csv
"print "hello world"",""hello world".print()"
```

### Writing Effective CSV Entries
Learning from existing CSV files is a great way to grasp the expected format and style. When writing a CSV to train the model on the 'loop' keyword, consider multiple perspectives and scenarios:

### Basic comprehension: "What keyword is used for loops?"
Variations and alternatives: "Is 'loop' the only keyword for creating loops?"
Practical application: "Provide an example of a loop counting from 1 to 20."
Code correction: "Fix the following code: loop { i = i+1 }."
In-depth concepts: "What is the purpose of a 'break' in a loop?"
Potential pitfalls: "What are the dangers of a loop?"
By covering a concept from various angles, you help the AI develop a nuanced understanding. Missing perspectives can lead to inaccurate inferences or hallucinations.

### Integrating into the Dataset
A notebook within the dataset directory is designed to concatenate these CSV files into the format required by the model. Running this notebook validates the format and, given appropriate permissions, allows you to upload the updated dataset to platforms like HuggingFace.

In the following sections, we'll delve deeper into each step, ensuring that you can confidently contribute to the model's corpus and aid in its development.

Contributing to a language model's training corpus with a CSV file is both an art and a science. Here, we will outline the steps and best practices for creating your CSV files that will be ingested into the model's training routine.

### Step 1: Define Your Objective

Begin by clearly defining what you want to teach the model. Whether it's a new language feature, a programming concept, or an advanced theoretical principle, having a clear objective will guide the structure and content of your CSV file.

### Step 2: Gather Your Content

Once your objective is set, gather the content. This might include documentation, textbooks, online articles, or your own knowledge. If you're sourcing from the web or published works, remember to credit these in the `sources.txt` file.

### Step 3: Structure Your Questions and Answers

Your CSV should be a dialogue between the trainer and the model. Questions should be clear and cover various aspects of the topic. Answers must be concise, correct, and relevant. Here's an example structure for a CSV entry on a new programming concept:

```csv
question,answer
"How do you declare a variable in the new language X?","In language X, a variable can be declared using the let keyword: let x = 10;"
"What's a unique feature of functions in language X?","Language X functions can return multiple values, like this: fn example() { return (val1, val2); }"
```

### Step 4: Edit and Proofread Your Entries
Accuracy is crucial, as the model will learn from what you feed it. Proofread your CSV entries for grammatical errors, ensure technical accuracy, and validate that the formatting is consistent with the model's requirements. For instance, if you copy part of telegram conversation, make sure you do not copy text containing some smileys, or jokes.

### Step 5: Validate Your CSV Format
Before your CSV can join the training corpus, it must pass format validation. This involves checking that the syntax is correct and that there are no extraneous spaces or misplaced quotation marks. Use CSV linting tools or scripts if available.

The most common mistakes:
"Question", "answer" <- Make sure there is no space before or after the ","
"print hello"," sure, "hello".print()" <- use ' instead of " or use 'hello'


### Step 6: Push to the Dataset
After validation, use the provided notebook in the "build Dataset" directory to integrate your new CSV file into the corpus. This process involves concatenating individual CSV files and formatting them to meet the ingestion specifications of the model.

The data are included with a prefix: "In cairo 1:", so you do not have to specify the version of Cairo, unless you want to specify knowledge for previous or future versions of the language

### Step 7: Review and Iterate
Post-ingestion, keep an eye on the model's performance. If issues arise or if the model starts generating inaccurate or nonsensical content, revisit your CSV entries. It might require to re-run fine-tuning or even rewriting sections that are causing confusion.

### The Importance of Diversity in Training Data
To build a well-rounded and robust language model, the training data must be diverse and inclusive of various dialects, jargon, and forms of expression. This diversity ensures that the model does not develop biases and can perform well across different domains and applications.

So you're welcome to write the same question multiple time paraphrasing the original question, delivering the same answer. This has to be especially done on concepts that are similar to other languages. For instance, there is no "for" keyword in Cairo, but there is in Rust and Mistral is trained on Rust sources. 

### Covering Edge Cases
When creating training data, don't forget to include edge cases. These are scenarios that might not be common but are critical to ensuring the model can handle a wide range of possible inputs it might encounter in the real world.

### Balancing the Dataset
Ensure that no single topic dominates the training corpus. Balance is key so that the model doesn't become overfitted to particular phrases, styles, or topics. A balanced dataset will result in a model that's more versatile and reliable.

### Continuous Learning and Model Improvement
The process of contributing to a language model's training corpus is ongoing. Language evolves, new technologies emerge, and the model must adapt to these changes. Your contributions help keep the model current and effective.


### Collaborative Efforts
Contributing to a training corpus is often a collaborative effort. Work with other contributors to ensure that the corpus grows not just in size but also in quality and scope. Make sure you don't provide more data in your domain of expertise than others, or there will be balancing issues.

### Leveraging Community Feedback
Listen to the feedback from users of the model. They can provide insights into what the model does well and where it needs improvement. Use this feedback to guide your contributions.

### Conclusion
By following these guidelines, you can make meaningful contributions to a language model's training corpus. Your efforts will aid in the model's development, helping it to understand and generate language with greater accuracy and nuance.

Remember that the quality of a language model's output can only be as good as the training data it receives. Your meticulous attention to detail, commitment to diversity, and continuous engagement are vital to the model's success.
